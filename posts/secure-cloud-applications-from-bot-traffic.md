## How to Block Bad Bots: Safeguarding Your WordPress Site

Bot Traffic on websites has been increasing for small or large businesses globally. These traffic bots are crawling every website they can find, including spam bots and cause some serious SEO damage to websites. They usually find a way, by using open backdoors of a website or gaining access to a less-protected network to target the site. Traffic bots can create an abnormally high bounce rate, abnormally high and low session views, generate a huge amount of traffic on the site, false account generation and many more such consequences to bot traffic attacks. So if you observe anomalies (generally spikes) in your web traffic, your site might be a target of a traffic bot attack. An increase in Bot Traffic leads to an increase in website traffic, which leads to an increase in false data, false data is of no use to any company.

In this blog, we will see the common bot traffic attacks on WordPress sites, and how we can prevent bot traffic attacks.

### Why does your organization need a Reverse Proxy to secure WordPress websites and cloud applications to prevent bot traffic? {#why-bot-traffic}

**The 4 most common bad bot attacks used on WordPress sites are:**

**1. Spam Bots:** Bot traffic can be used for spamming any webpage or cloud application with various comments or unwanted traffic. To mitigate these issues, it’s crucial to implement measures to block bot activities.

**2.DDS Attacks:** Bot traffic will attack the application which will create huge traffic and take your site down with a Denial of Service attack. To safeguard against such attacks, proactive steps to block bot infiltration should be taken.

**3.Ad Fraud:** Bot traffic will visit the advertisement present on your application and affect the ad clicks, which will affect the cost of the advertisement. This deceptive behavior may involve fraudulent clicks on ads, along with suspicious Bot Comments.

**4.Content Scraping:** Bot traffic can be used for extracting data from the application, including sensitive content, damaging the SEO of your WordPress website. This could also include instances where bots generate automated Bot Comments on your content.

According to many resources, around 20-30% of Cloud Applications traffic is equipped by Traffic Bot. This tells us that 20-30% money is wasted on these Bot Traffic attacks. Bot Traffic attacks don’t majorly harm the Cloud App security but it does affect the analytics of the Cloud Applications in measures like bounce rate, session duration, location of the user and many more. These attacks can cost a lot to companies who have online or website presence.

The company has to bear the loss of $30 as the 30 clicks of the advertisements are blocked by bots or stopped by bot attacks, rendering them wasted.
