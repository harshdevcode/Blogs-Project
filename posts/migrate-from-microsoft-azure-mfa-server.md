### Key advantages of using miniOrange Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) {#key-advantages-of-using-miniorange-multi-factor-authentication-mfa}

- miniOrange provides a solution to the migration path for Azure MFA customers providing a smooth workflow process and a good user interface. Authentication is the most crucial and identity security solution to avoid much brute force, phishing attacks, credentials stuffing and secure access to the data for all the workspaces and customer authorizations.
- Replacing Azure MFA server with [miniOrange Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](https://www.miniorange.com/blog/what-is-multi-factor-authentication-mfa/) helps you in authenticating users by verifying two or more verification factors and ensuring the right set of authentication to your sensitive information and protect user identities on both cloud and on-premise which is not provided by Azure MFA server in on-premise.
- With the increase of security risks across global organizations, miniOrange updated the features with [15+ authentication methods](https://www.miniorange.com/iam/content-library/admin-docs/configure-mfa-methods-for-admins) that include SoftToken, Push, QR Code using Google, Microsoft, and [miniOrange authenticator app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miniorange.android.authenticator&hl=en_IN&gl=US) and Hardware Tokens like- Yubikey, Display with various popular integrations with [OpenVPN](https://www.miniorange.com/two-factor-authentication-for-open-vpn), [Fortinet](https://www.miniorange.com/two-factor-authentication-for-fortinet), [Windows](https://www.miniorange.com/two-factor-authentication-(2fa)-for-windows-login-and-rdp), [Sharepoint](https://www.miniorange.com/two-factor-authentication-(2fa)-for-sharepoint), [Office 365](https://www.miniorange.com/two-factor-authentication-(2fa)-for-office-365), and many more.
- In this era of telecommunication, MFA allows employees to safely access data from any device or location without putting sensitive data at risk. Having a second form of identification greatly decreases the chance of a hacker gaining access to corporate devices or other sensitive information.
