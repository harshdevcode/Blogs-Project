A study by [Security.org](https://seon.io/resources/statistics-account-takeover-fraud/) claims that around 22% of adults in the US fell victim to account takeover fraud in 2022, with average losses of around $12,000 per case. 

This poses a significant threat to both Shopify merchants and customers, leading to financial losses, compromised data, and a decline in customer loyalty and trust. To deal with such growing security challenges, miniOrange has designed Shopify OTP Verification solutions to secure customer’s entire purchase journey. 

&nbsp;

In this blog, we’ll understand [OTP verification](https://plugins.miniorange.com/login-with-otp-into-shopify) solutions and how they can help prevent fraudulent activities on your Shopify store.



## Why Need OTP Verification On Shopify Store? {#why-need-otp-verification}

One-Time Password (OTP) verification adds an extra layer of security to your Shopify store. It effectively reduces the risks associated with account takeovers, preventing unauthorized purchases and fraudulent transactions. 

&nbsp;

For instance, with a login OTP at checkout, Shopify merchants can make order purchases more secure by allowing only verified users with confirmed identities to complete transactions. This protects customer information, lessens potential financial loss, and creates a more secure and trustworthy experience for Shopify merchants and customers.

## Shopify Store ‘Without’ OTP Login/Verification {#without-otp-verification}

Not implementing One-Time Password (OTP) solutions in Shopify stores can bring about various security risks, like:

&nbsp;

- **Fraudulent Transactions:** Without an OTP login, there is a high risk of unauthorized purchases, account takeovers, and payment fraud. This could result in huge financial losses for Shopify store owners.

&nbsp;

- **Inventory Loss:** A lack of OTP verification can lead to fake orders being placed, resulting in fewer products available in your inventory. This could stop genuine customers from placing orders.

&nbsp;

- **Account Breaches:** The absence of OTP verification leaves customer accounts susceptible to hacking attempts. This compromises personal information, payment details, and order history, risking privacy violations and potential identity theft.

&nbsp;

- **Revenue Loss and Brand Damage:**  Instances of fraud or security breaches caused by a lack of OTP verification can result in financial losses, chargebacks, and harm to the brand’s reputation.

&nbsp;

- **Lower Trust and Credibility:** Failing to implement OTP verification might reduce customer trust in your store's security. Customers may feel less confident about transaction safety, leading to abandoned carts or hesitancy in making purchases on the platform.

&nbsp;

To tackle such issues, Shopify stores should integrate secure and user-friendly OTP verification solutions like the miniOrange OTP Login plugin to improve security without compromising the user experience.
