## User Provisioning App : Keeps you in sync with multiple Atlassian applications! {#keeps-you-in-sync-with-multiple-atlassian-applications}

Picture this: You have 1000s of users. Each user accesses multiple atlassian applications like Jira and Confluence and some of them keep facing issues with user access, activation and deletion which by the time you resolve, you have another pile waiting for you. Sounds familiar? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;

How are you going to manage user provisioning and de-provisioning and access of every user for each application? Manually managing large numbers of users is equivalent to putting out fires all day long. We’ve got you covered with our User Provisioning /SCIM add-on, which can help you to handle your users/employees instantly and effortlessly across atlassian applications for Jira SCIM and Confluence SCIM. Wondering how is it possible? We will help you to understand exactly how it can be done.

### What is User Provisioning and Deprovisioning? {#user-provisioning-and-deprovisioning}

User Provisioning is the process of creating, updating and/or deleting a user’s account and access through multiple applications at once. In our particular case this user sync or SCIM can be applied to Atlassian applications for Jira User Sync and Confluence User Sync. Provisioning provides information about users / employees such as their name, attributes, groups and other relevant data allowing them to grant or revoke access as required. Some of the real time examples like hiring, promotions, transfers can set off provisioning. Provisioning ensures user’s access rights are up to date, without manual efforts for each user across all applications.

### Why is User Provisioning / Deprovisioning important? {#Why-is-user-provisioning-deprovisioning-important}

- Automatically create, update, deactivate or activate user accounts across applications.
- Saves time, manages users directory at one place and keeps everything else sync with directory.
- Automatically assign role-based permissions within apps
- Ensure the prevention of unauthorized access by automatically revoking access to all apps at once – de-provisioning.
