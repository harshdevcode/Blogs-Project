Lots of companies are now allowing their employees to work from home, the office, or anywhere else, all thanks to cloud apps and services. Employees can now use cloud platforms to access their work-related data from anywhere, at any time, subsequently maintaining a healthy work-life balance. 

But here’s the catch: all this seamless and quick access to cloud apps and data is possible because of servers located worldwide. Traditional network setups that businesses often use aren’t designed to cope with this, making things slow and sometimes not very secure. 

That’s where Secure Access Service Edge, or SASE, comes in. It’s a special kind of tool that is designed for our modern, roam-free work life.

&nbsp;

But what exactly is SASE, and why is it so important for businesses today? 

Let’s find out!

## The Basics: What is SASE?

Imagine you own a company that has offices in New York, Tokyo, and London, with teams working remotely from all across the globe. Everyone within your company is using online tools like Google Drive and Salesforce for document storage and customer management. 

&nbsp;

Let’s say Sarah, one of your employees from the London-based office, needs to update customer data in Salesforce and access files on Google Drive.

**Without SASE** in place, Sarah might get slow access to these cloud apps due to backhauling traffic to the data center. Her access to these apps might also be less secure, putting confidential company data at risk.

&nbsp;

However, **with SASE**, when Sarah tries to connect to these cloud services, **the system will first verify Sarah's identity and her device's security status.** Once approved, SASE will **then determine the quickest and safest route for her data** to travel across the internet, Google Drive, and Salesforce servers to update and access files. 

So, to put it in simple words, Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) makes sure that the right people get quick and safe access to the necessary cloud apps and data, no matter where they are or what type of device they're using, all while keeping bad actors out.


## What is SASE Architecture? {#sase-architecture}

Consider having a simple and convenient system that takes care of both your network performance and security all in one place. That's what SASE architecture is. Whether you are working in the office or from home, SASE makes accessing cloud services a breeze.

In the past, traditional cloud security systems focused on creating a security perimeter, something like a protective bubble around your network. But this approach had its limitations, especially for employees who worked remotely.

SASE architecture breaks free from these limitations. It goes above and beyond to give your business a flexible and speedy solution without compromising on security. So no matter where your employees are working, they can enjoy seamless access to cloud services without any worries.


## SASE Components Explained {#explained}

Diving deeper, Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) isn't just a single tool or piece of software but a suite of components working together. 

Let's check these SASE security components one by one:

### Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) {#software-defined}

SD-WAN, a key component of Secure Access Service Edge that manages network performance and bandwidth optimization, acts as a smart guide that securely connects your users to cloud apps and activities, irrespective of their location. The system makes sure that cloud data and apps can be easily accessed over the internet, enhancing performance and reducing costs while meeting the organization's security policies and compliance requirements. It is an essential part of the SASE framework, which enables secure, dynamic, and optimized connectivity that modern businesses demand.

### Secure Service Edge (SSE) {#secure-service-edge}

SSE is the security component of SASE that acts as a security guard for your cloud apps and activities. When your employees are using cloud services for work, SSE makes sure **only authorized personnel can access certain information** and keeps unwanted visitors out. This is done by checking who’s trying to enter and what permission they have as per security policy. This means you can safely use cloud services and websites without worrying about cyber threats or data leaks.

&nbsp;

SSE further comprises several subcomponents for securing the cloud infrastructure, which include the following:

 **1. Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB):** Think of [CASB](https://www.miniorange.com/casb/) as the mediator that enforces your organization's security policies when users want to access cloud services, **ensuring secure and compliant use of cloud applications**. It checks what’s being sent and received, making sure your sensitive business data is secure and protected. Essentially, CASB helps your company use cloud apps and services without compromising on safety, acting as a watchful protector.

&nbsp;

 **2. Secure Web Gateway (SWG):** Another key element of SASE, Secure Web Gateway (SWG) **checks the online services and websites your employees are trying to visit are protected** and follow the rules set by your company and internet usage policies. It also filters unwanted software/malware from user-initiated web/internet traffic and blocks unauthorized access.

&nbsp;

 **3. Firewall as a Service (FWaaS):** FWaaS is like having a virtual firewall that keeps an eye on everything coming in and going out of your network, making sure no viruses or hackers can get through. It **inspects and filters traffic between your network and the internet** based on set security policies. FWaaS works everywhere you need it to — whether employees are working from home, in the office, or on the go. This means your business is always protected.

&nbsp;

 **4. Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** [Data Loss Prevention](https://www.miniorange.com/data-loss-prevention-dlp) (DLP) is a security component of Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) that **prevents unauthorized users from accessing your company's confidential data**. DLP makes sure that your sensitive business information doesn’t get accidentally shared or stolen. Think of it like a filter that stops your confidential information from getting transferred when it shouldn’t. This way, DLP helps keep your business-critical files safe and ensures you meet privacy standards and regulations.  

&nbsp;

 **5. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** EDR is a security service of SASE that **monitors the devices in use to detect cyber threats like malware that are present on the device**. With EDR, the SOC team can monitor and gain detailed insights into security incidents and make decisions to mitigate them in the future.

### Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) {#ztna}

ZTNA is the latest addition under the umbrella of Secure Access Service Edge to verify users and authenticate their permissions before accessing any cloud services.
