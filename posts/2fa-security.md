With the rise in cloud storage and the advent of the internet, more and more businesses are moving their operations/data online. This has greatly reduced storage costs and eased business operations. Individual users have also greatly benefited from the internet to send text messages, post stories on social media sites, or learn a new skill.  

However, with the rise of the internet, data security has become an important factor for businesses. If the data is not protected, it leaves businesses vulnerable to hackers and other data breaches. Having multiple accounts on various platforms solicits more avenues for phishing attacks. This can lead to big losses for the data owners.  

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Security is a seamless way to add an extra layer of protection to your data and services – and miniOrange provides you with the widest array of 2FA Security methods as compared to any other vendors on the market.


### What is Two-Factor Authentication? {#what-is-two-factor-authentication}
[Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)](https://miniorange.com/two-factor-authentication-(2fa)) also called two-step verification or multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security process in which a user has to pass two different authentication factors to gain access to an account or a computer system.  

The first factor is some basic information you know: username and password. However, instead of only asking for a username and password, 2FA (Two-Factor authentication) Security adds additional verification factors (OTP, push notifications, fingerprint, etc.) which indirectly halts any cyber attackers’ activities like phishing, malware, etc. by providing a high level of assurance and security. By enabling 2FA Security, you’ll add an additional layer of security, making it harder for attackers to access the data through a person’s device or an online account.  

The goal of this is to have another layer of security. In the event that the username and password of an individual or an organization are compromised, the data is still protected by the other layer of security.

 

### How does 2FA Security work? {#how-does-2fa-security-work}
As the user attempts to gain access to a specific resource, they are prompted with multiple authentication factors, instead of only one. The user credentials are then verified by a core [identity provider](https://blog.miniorange.com/what-is-an-identity-provider-idp/) (IdP – such as miniOrange IDP) or a directory services platform. Once authenticated, the user gains access to the requested resource.  

The most common 2FA Security systems use a unique one-time passcode commonly known as OTP with every login attempt that you simply make. miniOrange also provides a more modern and secure sort of 2FA Security which is “Push notification” on your smartphone. A push notification is sent to your registered smartphone and in order to gain access to your account, you’ve got to approve that notification. You can also use a hardware token to gain access to crucial resources using tokens such as Yubikey, or soft tokens via Google/Microsoft/miniOrange authenticator app.
