### What is Just in Time (JIT) Provisioning? {#what-is-just-in-time-(jit)-provisioning}
We understand that change can be frightening, but cyber attacks are becoming faster and more sophisticated. Cyber criminals have evolved into members of complex ecosystems that handle everything from selling access to hacked accounts to developing large-scale attack payloads and even handling the financial aspect of extortion. Major events are occurring on a weekly basis, and 2022 is expected to be no different.

An easy, reliable, and innovative video-first unified communications platform, Zoom, provides video meetings, voice, webinars, and chat across all devices and spaces. Hence, it became our priority to secure it for users using it in their day-to-day life.

Zoom Single sign-on (SSO) allows you to log in to your Zoom account using your existing credentials. Credentials here means existing Organizational Identity, Directory, Database, or Identity Provider (Azure Active Directory, Ping, ADFS, Database) where your users are stored. A connection with miniOrange as an identity provider (IDP), and Zoom as a service provider (SP), simplifies login functionality as your users don’t need to create an account and maintain a username and password for your Zoom and Organization separately. 

### Benefits of Zoom Single Sign On (SSO) {#benefits-of-zoom-single-sign-on-(sso)}
