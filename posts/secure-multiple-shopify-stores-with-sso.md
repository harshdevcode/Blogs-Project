eCommerce businesses are running more than one online store these days to broaden their customer reach and tap into emerging markets. This trend will likely continue for years to come. Projections indicate that by 2040, nearly 95% of all purchases will be made online. However, maintaining the security of multiple online stores has become a challenge for e commerce brands. Ensuring prompt user authentication and synchronizing information across multiple Shopify stores can largely impact online businesses.  
[miniOrange Shopify Single Sign-On (SSO)](https://plugins.miniorange.com/shopify-single-sign-on) provides an answer to this. The solution centralizes user authentication and enhances security measures across all Shopify stores. This becomes especially crucial for businesses with e-stores across multiple locations and countries worldwide.  
In this blog, we’ll explore how e-businesses can improve Shopify security and streamline user authentication across their online stores using miniOrange Shopify SSO solutions.  
So, let’s dive in  

## Why Secure Multiple Shopify Stores? {#why-secure-multiple-shopify-stores}
If you own, or plan to run, multiple Shopify stores for your e-commerce business, then you should be aware of the security issues that may fall your way. Protecting more than one online store through a single Shopify application can be tough. Just setting up passwords won’t do the trick. You’ll have to make sure each store is reinforced with strong security features and updates.  
Keeping track of multiple shops on Shopify and ensuring the same level of security & authentication can be tricky. With multiple stores, chances are that unauthorized users could try to break in. So, it's essential to have a good plan to keep things safe and running. Furthermore, different countries have different rules when it comes to operating an e-commerce business. So abiding by them can get complicated when you have multiple online stores to run.  

## Challenges of Multiple Shopify Stores {#challenges-of-multiple-shopify-stores}

 - **Security Measures**  
   Securing Shopify multi stores can be tough, as it involves setting up different safety rules for each store. Implementing the same level of security can take a lot of time and get complicated.  
   
&nbsp;  
  
 - **User Authentication**  
   Handling user logins for more than one Shopify store entails keeping track of usernames, passwords, and who can see what in each store. As the number of stores increases, it becomes difficult to keep everything organized.  

&nbsp; 

- **Consistent Security**  
  It is important to keep all Shopify stores equally safe. However, making sure they all get the same security updates and changes can be a real challenge.

&nbsp; 

- **Increased Vulnerabilities**  
  Having more Shopify stores increases the risk of potential vulnerabilities, as each store can become an entry point for cyber threats.

&nbsp; 

- **Integration Difficultiess**  
  Certain stores require special tools or solutions. A lack of standard operating procedures or compatibility problems could make it difficult to integrate security systems seamlessly.

&nbsp; 
  
Therefore, it is essential to centralize authentication and simplify security protocols for operating multiple Shopify stores. Companies are frequently looking to integrate solutions like Single Sign-On (SSO) services, like the miniOrange Shopify SSO, to prevent such security hurdles.

## How miniOrange Secures Multiple Shopify Stores? {#how-miniorange-support-multiple-shopify-stores}
miniOrange Shopify SSO offers a wide range of security features to protect multiple shops on Shopify. Here are some of its key features:

1. **Easy Access**  
   Access multiple stores with a single set of credentials using the miniOrange Single Sign-On (SSO) solution. It centralizes user credentials into an IDP, which streamlines user management, simplifies authentication processes, and provides a single platform for monitoring and managing user access to multiple Shopify stores. This reduces administrative overhead and enables administrators to easily decide who can access what across your online stores.

&nbsp; 
  
2. **Inventory Synchronization**  
   miniOrange Shopify SSO makes it easier to control and centralize the management of product stock and availability across multiple Shopify stores. It provides a unified platform to check and update what products are there, how many are left, and if they’re available for sale in different stores. With this system, businesses can quickly make sure all their Shopify stores show the same product information and keep track of how much stock is left. This helps them stop selling out-of-stock products and avoid mix-ups about products across all their Shopify stores. 

&nbsp; 
  
3. **Customized Security**  
   Make each Shopify store safe the way you want. miniOrange SSO helps businesses protect every store in a personalized and strong way. The solution lets administrators create customized rules, like using different ways to log in, like multi-factor authentication (MFA) or role-based access. This granular approach makes everything more secure and gives businesses the freedom to meet the specific safety needs of each Shopify store.  

&nbsp; 
  
4. **Profile Synchronization**  
   Keep user profiles the same across all Shopify stores. The profile syncing feature makes sure user information, such as account details, preferences, and settings, remains consistent and updated across all linked Shopify stores. This eliminates the need for users to create separate profiles or re-enter information when accessing different Shopify stores. It further makes things easier for businesses and keeps all your customer details consistent, no matter which Shopify store they are using.  

&nbsp; 
  

## SSO Solutions for Multiple Shopify Stores {#sso-solutions-for-multiple-shopify-stores}

1. **Shopify Store as IDP**  
   With Shopify Store as IDP solution, one store can act as an identity provider. That is, users can log in and access other stores using one main store's credentials. User credentials will be maintained in the main store and sign-ups will be allowed in that store only. This centralizes user authentication, enhancing convenience and security across multiple stores within the Shopify ecosystem.

&nbsp;

2. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**  
   Allow users to navigate seamlessly between different Shopify stores using any identity provider credentials with Single Sign-On (SSO). Connect all your stores to the centralized identity provider, allowing users to access those stores using IDP credentials. This eliminates the need to repeatedly log in using different usernames and passwords. It simplifies the user experience, enhances security by centralizing authentication protocols, and enables strong security measures across all connected stores. Ultimately, it optimizes user convenience across multiple Shopify stores while maintaining a high level of security.

&nbsp;

3. **System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)**
   Using SCIM (System for Cross-Domain Identity Management) across multiple Shopify stores makes handling user accounts easier. It helps admins quickly set up and remove user accounts. SCIM also makes sure that user details, like profiles and what they are allowed to access, are the same in all the Shopify stores connected to it. This centralized approach enhances security by ensuring that user access is promptly updated or revoked across all connected stores, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

&nbsp; 

## Conclusion {#conclusion}
Using Single Sign-On (SSO) across multiple Shopify stores makes things much better for businesses and users. It transforms the login experience, as users only need one set of login credentials to access all Shopify stores. Plus, SSO makes sure all the stores are safe by using advanced security features, ensuring robust authentication protocols and streamlined access controls across the network of Shopify stores. Ultimately, Shopify SSO improves how users log in, keeps everything secure, and makes managing all the stores easier for businesses. [Click here to contact us](mailto:shopifysupport@xecurify.com)
