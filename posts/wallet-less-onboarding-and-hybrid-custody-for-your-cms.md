## How does Wallet-less Onboarding work for CMS Platforms? 

Wallet-less Onboarding is the process of **creating new users on a blockchain-based platform without the precondition of owning a crypto wallet**. This provides numerous benefits for any Web3 project. The traditional Web2 login methods can now be used to onboard users.

This promotes easy, wide scale and swift adoption of blockchain technology – which is the greatest concern in the Web3 landscape.

### How does Hybrid Custody work for CMS Platforms? {#how-does-hybrid-custody-works}

Hybrid Custody is a state of crypto custody in which user’s blockchain assets are managed by the platform (app custody) and themselves (self-custody) both. This means that the **application performs all blockchain transactions** on the user’s behalf, simplifying the user experience tremendously, while the user maintains ownership of the blockchain assets and can claim these at any time using a self-custody wallet.

It is not only that the user can claim ownership of their app wallet, they can use both their app wallet as well as their self-custodial wallet to manage their assets. A user does not have to choose between one of the two, he can use both. Therefore, if your users wish to continue using their blockchain assets on your platform, they can do so, while at the same time utilizing these assets on external platforms via their self-custodial wallet.

This is achieved by **account abstraction and account delegation**. Through these techniques, the user can delegate access of their app wallet to their self-custodial wallet. This enables them to retain true ownership of their blockchain assets while also maintaining full functionality within the app ecosystem.
