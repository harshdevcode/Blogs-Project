## What is CASB Cloud Security? {#what-is-casb}

A CASB, or [Cloud Access Security Broker](https://www.miniorange.com/casb/), is a security tool that helps businesses secure their data stored on the cloud apps from data breaches, malware, and unauthorized user access to the data. CASBs are an essential part of any organization’s infrastructure to help them with data protection, providing deep user visibility, advanced threat mitigation, and help them in staying compliant with the industry-standard security requirements.

### What is a DLP? {#what-is-dlp}

DLP, or Data Loss Prevention is a solution that encrypts your sensitive data and controls the transfer of this data outside the company network. It actively checks for security flaws and loopholes left for data breaches that need to be blocked. Upon deploying a DLP, it will work to secure you against malicious emails asking for personal information, sending unknown mail attachments, detecting risky links, and scanning for sensitive data stored on unmanaged folders, all to secure employee identity and company data from foreign threats.

### CASB vs DLP {#casb-vs-dlp}

Let’s compare and understand the difference between a [Cloud Access Security Broker](https://www.miniorange.com/casb/solutions/) and a Data Loss Prevention in detail.

- **Requirements:** CASBs are meant for securing user access and managing user access to different data stored on the cloud apps. DLP is designed for controlling data flow within the organization and apps, to prevent the leaking of sensitive company confidential data and employee personal information, detect malicious links, and use algorithms to detect when data transfer needs to be blocked.

- **Detection Rules:** CASBs detect security breaches across the huge network for the entire organization to check for data leaks. DLP is meant to scan devices across teams to check who accesses and downloads which company data.

- **Scope:** The general scope of a CASB is to restrict a third-party application over the company network from accessing data outside its scope. Whereas a DLP is designed to secure sensitive data on devices and prevent phishing user information through malicious download links sent over emails.

### Why do I need a CASB and DLP for my industry? {#why-casb-and-dlp}

In an organization, a lot of information is passed between teams every day. To protect any sort of data infringement. An example of this would be, suppose a company is using [Google Workspace](https://www.miniorange.com/casb/integrations/google-workspace) apps, storing their confidential documents on Google Docs, mail attachments sent over Gmail, company and partners meeting scheduled over Google Meet, and more. All these points of data exchange need to be secured from unauthorized user access or third-party app access.

To efficiently manage all user groups, the SOC team needs to set up granular access permissions, prevent unauthorized downloads, manage app usage, and stay security compliant. This helps the SOC teams detect threat vectors, you need the combination of both CASB and DLP for G Suite to secure your Google Workspace apps.

CASB and DLP are designed to keep your business secure from data breach threats, stay compliant with industry best practices, defend against malware and ransomware threats, and provide deep visibility into user actions to detect irregular behavior that could be a security threat. With these features, a CASB and DLP can work together to secure any and all your Cloud apps.

### How can a CASB and DLP together provide Cloud Data Security? {#casb-dlp-together}

Let’s now look at the working of a [CASB](https://www.miniorange.com/blog/what-are-the-4-pillars-of-casb/) and DLP for Cloud Data Security with a real-world example.

| DLP | CASB |
|-----|-------|
| DLP solutions primarily focus on preventing sensitive data from being lost, misused, or accessed by unauthorized individuals. | CASB cloud solutions primarily focus on securing cloud-based applications and services. They provide visibility, control, and protection for data stored in cloud environments, including Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications |
|DLP solutions majorly work on content inspection, contextual analysis, and policy-based rules.|CASB protection rules work on user roles and access-based restrictions for cloud app security.|
|DLP protection works on the system level which means if users log in to the cloud application on another system, the DLP solution won’t be effective.|CASB cloud solution works on the Cloud the restrictions applied over here are system independent.|
|DLP protection includes services like USB blocking, Bluetooth Blocking, and all the other ways possible to share data from one system to another.|CASB cloud solution has no such features as it is based on the restriction policies which are applied for SaaS applications.|
|DLP solutions provide extensive visibility into data flows, both within the organization’s network and outside its boundaries.|CASB cloud solution offer visibility into the cloud application usage, user activities, and data interactions within the cloud environments.|
|DLP solutions enforce security policies based on the content and context of data. They mostly rely on predefined rules and patterns to identify and prevent unauthorized data transfers, leakage, or misuse. DLP protection policies can be granular and specific, allowing organizations to define rules based on data classification, user roles, and other criteria.|CASB cloud solution enforces security policies primarily at the application level within cloud environments. They provide granular control over user access, authentication, and authorization within cloud applications. CASBs enable organizations to enforce protection policies regarding data sharing, collaboration, and external sharing permissions within specific cloud services.|

### In Summary {#conclusion}

In this blog, we saw how a CASB cloud security solution and DLP solution work together for securing all your [Cloud apps](https://www.miniorange.com/blog/atlassian-security-for-jira-and-confluence-with-casb/) for providing airtight data security, compliance inclusion, malware detection, threat protection, monitoring user behavior, and deep visibility for the SOC teams know about the potential surface areas exposed to loopholes and threats.

So if you are on the market looking for a cloud data security solution with a CASB and DLP, miniOrange is the top solution to help you stay ahead of the growing data threats, boosting team productivity, all available at the most cost-effective pricing.
