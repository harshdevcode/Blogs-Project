## How miniOrange CASB Secures Your Salesforce Apps?

Salesforce is one of the most popular CRM tools that manages all customer data, like contact details, sales history, and even how the product is delivered. It has proven to be great for businesses, big or small, that sell to both B2B and B2C customers.

&nbsp;

It was the very first CRM system that you could access over the Internet. This means employees can access Salesforce cloud apps from anywhere with an internet connection, making it incredibly flexible and helping boost productivity. But that's not all! Salesforce also offers a complete 360-degree view of the customer's journey, like what made them interested in your product and when they bought something from you. 

&nbsp;

However, Salesforce management can become tricky for your organization. The job of protecting user access to Salesforce apps, preventing data leaks, and ensuring compliance with data security regulations falls entirely on your security team. 

&nbsp;

miniOrange can help your security team tackle these challenges with [Salesforce CASB](https://www.miniorange.com/casb/integrations/salesforce) (Cloud Access Security Broker) solutions. 

&nbsp;

Letâ€™s understand why data security is important for Salesforce apps and how Salesforce CASB by miniOrange protects your apps from account takeovers, sensitive data leakage, and malicious file uploads.


### What is Salesforce Data Security? {#what-is-salesforce-data-security}

Salesforce Data Security is all about protecting your business data that is stored in your Salesforce Cloud apps. It ensures that only authorized users can access and modify this data on Salesforce apps.

Imagine a scenario where a user or app mishandles Salesforce data, violating your company's data policies. This could lead to a security breach and serious consequences.

That's where Salesforce Data Security steps in. It acts as a powerful control center, enforcing data access and permissions for all users and apps interacting with your Salesforce Cloud information.


### What are the threats to your Salesforce Cloud Apps? {#what-are-the-threats-to-salesforce-cloud-apps}

Imagine Salesforce as a giant filing cabinet full of important information about your customers and business deals. This information is valuable, so hackers and even dishonest employees might try to steal it.

&nbsp;

Here's why Salesforce data might be vulnerable:

- **Lots of access points:** Since many people in your company use Salesforce, there are more opportunities for someone to get in and steal information.
&nbsp;
- **Insider threats:** An employee with high-level access could take your customer data.

&nbsp;

This looming threat cannot be predicted. Your company needs to be more safe in ensuring Salesforce Data Security. To mitigate this, you need to use a [CASB solutions](https://www.miniorange.com/casb/solutions/) to provide transparency in customer data management, define user group access over different platforms, be compliant with industry standards, and ultimately provide complete data protection on Salesforce apps.

## What is a CASB? {#what-is-a-casb}

A [Cloud Access Security Broker](https://www.miniorange.com/casb/) (CASB) is a cloud security solution that helps businesses protect their cloud applications from unauthorized access and cyber threats. CASB solutions provide the Security Operations Center (SOC) team with comprehensive visibility into user behavior, enabling them to identify potential data security issues that could lead to data leakage. By monitoring user actions, CASBs can assess whether users pose a threat to the cloud application's data.

&nbsp;

The miniOrange Salesforce CASB Cloud security solution is designed to safeguard your customer data stored in the Salesforce cloud apps. It prevents cyber threats and unauthorized access aimed at stealing critical company data. Additionally, it supports and enforces data protection rules necessary for controlling the flow of information between users and applications within the Salesforce Cloud.

### How CASB Solution ensure Salesforce Data Security? {#how-casb-solution-ensure-salesforce-data-security}

We've discussed CASB security, but how does it specifically protect information within Salesforce applications? Let's explore Salesforce Cloud security through an example. Imagine a company using Salesforce for lead generation and customer analysis. This company has implemented the miniOrange Salesforce CASB security solution to set user access restrictions, ensuring that employees can only access information relevant to their roles.

&nbsp;

**User Access Levels: An Example**

Consider two users: Michael, the marketing head, and Dwight, an assistant analyst. Their roles within the organization determine their access to Salesforce data.

&nbsp;

- **Michael (Marketing Head):** He requires **full access** to the Salesforce Marketing Cloud to manage ad campaigns and generate leads. The Salesforce CASB security solution grants him complete control over marketing activities and customer data for targeted campaigns.

&nbsp;

- **Dwight (Assistant Analyst):** Dwight **only needs access to specific product** growth data within categories. He won't have full access to customer information; he will only have relevant customer fields for his tasks. The Salesforce CASB security solution ensures he cannot access sensitive customer data beyond his job requirements.

&nbsp;

In this way, [miniOrange Salesforce CASB](https://www.miniorange.com/blog/what-are-the-4-pillars-of-casb/) safeguards company data by managing user access controls. This promotes compliance and mitigates threats to customer data stored in Salesforce Cloud apps.

### Salesforce Shield vs Salesforce CASB {#salesforce-shield-vs-salesforce-casb}

**Salesforce Shield** and **Salesforce CASB** are both tools that can help you secure your Salesforce data and ensure compliance with regulations. Here's a breakdown of their strengths and weaknesses to help you decide which is best for your needs:

&nbsp;

 **Salesforce Shield:**

- **Pros:** Built-in solution for data protection, user access monitoring, and compliance.
- **Cons:** Cost is tied to your overall Salesforce spend, meaning more users can lead to a higher bill.

&nbsp;

**Salesforce CASB:**

- **Pros:** Typically priced per user, offering broader security features like granular access control, deep data visibility, and a wider range of compliance support.
- **Cons:** May require additional setup and configuration compared to the native Shield solution.

&nbsp;

**In Short:**
- **Shield is a good choice for:** Businesses already heavily invested in Salesforce who want a basic level of built-in security.
- **Salesforce CASB is a good choice for:** Businesses needing more comprehensive security features, per-user pricing, and deeper control over user access and data visibility.

### Benefits of CASB for Salesforce Apps {#benefits-of-casb-for-salesforce-apps}

Here are the top benefits of using the miniOrange CASB cloud security solution for Salesforce Cloud Data Security.

&nbsp;

- **Data Breach Protection:** Salesforce CASB safeguards and manages the flow of information between Salesforce Cloud apps and users. It continuously monitors app data permissions and user activities to detect potential data breaches, ensuring that information remains within the authorized scope and maintaining Salesforce Data Security.

&nbsp;

- **Compliance Inclusion:** By adhering to industry-standard security practices, Salesforce CASB security protects your sensitive data and business from threats. It ensures that unauthorized parties cannot access data stored in Salesforce Cloud apps, maintaining compliance and security.

&nbsp;

- **Malware Detection and Threat Protection:** Salesforce CASB provides robust defense against malware and malicious software targeting Salesforce Cloud apps. It prevents unauthorized data encryption (such as ransomware), ensuring the safety of all data stored within Salesforce Cloud apps.

&nbsp;

- **Control User Access Permissions:** To prevent over-sharing and manage user access to cloud apps, Salesforce CASB can monitor and restrict access to certain Salesforce Cloud apps. This control helps prevent data breaches by regulating access permissions.

&nbsp;

- **User Risk Score Assessment:** Salesforce CASB assigns a threat score to user profiles based on suspicious activities. When a user's risk score exceeds a set threshold, all access and permissions are revoked until reauthorized by the SOC administrator. This measure ensures that high-risk users are promptly identified and managed.

&nbsp;

- **Generate Security Reports:** Salesforce CASB enables the generation of security reports that detail threats it has mitigated over time. These reports provide SOC teams with valuable insights, allowing them to enhance security measures, update user permissions, and improve overall company productivity.

&nbsp;

- **Salesforce Zero Trust:** Salesforce Zero Trust is an advanced security approach for Salesforce Data Security and Cloud Security. It ensures continuous authentication, authorization, and validation of users, providing a secure flow of access and permissions while using Salesforce Cloud apps.
