### Overview of the benefits provided by WordPress two-factor authentication.

By investing in comprehensive security protocols i.e., two-factor authentication, big businesses can ensure the privacy of customer data, maintain operational continuity, and safeguard their reputation in an increasingly digital and interconnected world.

### What is two-factor authentication? {#What is two-factor authentication}

Explanation of the WordPress two-factor authentication process.

[Two-factor authentication (2FA)](https://plugins.miniorange.com/2-factor-authentication-for-wordpress-wp-2fa) is the implementation of an additional layer of security that requires a second form of verification apart from a traditional username and password.

Description of the different types of WordPress two-factor authentication methods.

This second-factor authentication can be SMS authentication, authentication via email, email verification, app authentication etc. Basically, you receive a 2FA code/One Time Password which is valid for a limited period to authenticate yourself to gain access to your account.

### Why is WordPress two-factor authentication important for “Big Businesses”? {#Why is WordPress two-factor authentication important for “Big Businesses”}
Why WordPress two-factor authentication is particularly important for big businesses?

WordPress Two-factor authentication (2FA) is particularly important for big businesses due to several reasons. Firstly, big businesses often hold a plethora of sensitive data, including customer information and financial details, making them attractive targets for hackers.

Secondly, big businesses typically have a larger number of employees, increasing the risk of password breaches or insider threats. 2FA ensures that attackers cannot gain access without the second factor even if employee passwords are compromised.

Real-life examples of big businesses experiencing data breaches or security threats.
The current pandemic has made everything digital, making online businesses more vulnerable to threats. Security breaches are on the rise and the number of attacks is growing every day.

There have been numerous instances where major corporations have fallen victim to data breaches or security threats, underscoring the importance of implementing robust security measures such as WordPress Two-factor authentication. One notable example is the Yahoo data breach in 2013, where hackers gained access to the personal information of more than 3 billion user accounts, including names, email addresses, and passwords. This incident had a severe impact on the company’s reputation and resulted in significant financial losses.

Others include the Equifax data breach in 2017, where the personal data of approximately 147 million consumers, including Social Security numbers and credit card information, was compromised.

Marriott in 2018, announced a data breach that compromised the personal information of approximately 500 million guests.

Target, a major US retailer, experienced a significant data breach. Cybercriminals infiltrated Target’s network and stole credit and debit card information of about 40 million customers. Additionally, the personal information of approximately 70 million customers. This scenario communicates a very clear message that it’s time to display an extraordinary sense of responsibility for big business. There is no room for complacency when it comes to adopting WordPress two-factor authentication.

Therefore, sometimes it is a regulatory requirement for big businesses to implement 2FA as an additional layer of security to protect sensitive information and prevent unauthorized access. 

## Choosing the Right WordPress 2FA Provider
