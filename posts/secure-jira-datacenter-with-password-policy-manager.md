## Secure Jira Datacenter With Password Policy Manager {#secure-jira-datacenter-with-password-policy-manager}

**Password security** is very important in today’s digital world. Atlassian allows you to create a secure environment by letting admins set password policies for users which specify the number of characters, type, and special characters.

[Advanced Password Policy Manager](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1228420/advanced-password-policy-manager-for-jira?hosting=datacenter&tab=overview) takes Jira password security to a different level, allowing you to set **tailored password policies**. It helps in improving password security and building **stronger system security**.  

With the add-on, you can allow the admin to set a **custom password** with the help of regular expressions. You can configure a set of **rules** using **regular expressions** (regex) that should be followed by the user while setting/updating their passwords.

&nbsp;

Admins can set multiple security policies like **length** of the **password**, **periodic password change**, as users allow access to a lot of sensitive information while using multiple applications, it is recommended for the Admins to enforce change of passwords frequently for the employees to keep the **data safe**. Admins can also set a **password expiry time** by forcing users to reset their passwords after a certain number of days in order to protect Jira from password interceptions. Admins can also send customized expiry notifications to users when their password expires. 

 &nbsp;

The admin can **limit login attempts**, i.e. the number of failed attempts by users to login, and can restrict access to Jira and JSM by **locking** the user accounts. Password policies can be enabled for your customers and agents for the ServiceDesk customer portal.
