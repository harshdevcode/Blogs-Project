### What is Adobe Captivate Prime? {#what-is-adobe-captive-prime}
Adobe Captivate Prime is an LMS (learning management system) created by Adobe to enable a simple and centralized learning delivery system for organizations to deliver courses/training/educational content for customers, clients, partners, and any other relevant stakeholders.


### What is the problem with Adobe Captivate Prime? {#what-is-the-problem-with-adobe-captive-prime}
Adobe Captivate Prime does not have a user registration process. What this means is, users of the application can not go onto the website, make their own accounts by putting in their details like username, password, e-mail address and begin using the service just like all other services.  

Adobe Captivate Prime requires a manual intervention – an Adobe Captivate Prime administrator needs to step in and individually generate a set of login credentials for each oncoming user and share these with the user. The process does not stop here, the administrator is also now required to share a password reset link with said user to ensure there is no credentials leakage between the users and the administrator. 

 
### What is the solution miniOrange provides? {#what-is-the-solution-miniorange-provides}
