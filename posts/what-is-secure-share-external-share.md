## What is Secure Share/External Share?

**[Jira External Share/Jira Secure Share](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1225074/mo-secure-share-issue-for-jira-external-share?hosting=cloud&tab=overview)** allows you to share your Jira issues or tickets to any user, externally too (even outside Jira). The **external shareable Jira cloud issue links** can also be **protected by password**, with that you can also set the expiration of the link after which the link won’t work, and you need to regenerate the link in order to share it again. Thus, your Jira project is kept secure at its zenith. It permits you to make and share access links for your Jira issues. **Your end-users will be able to access the shared Jira issues with these links!** 


**The secure share add-on is available for the Jira [cloud](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1225074/mo-secure-share-issue-for-jira-external-share?hosting=cloud&tab=overview), [data center](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1225074/mo-secure-share-issue-for-jira-external-share?hosting=datacenter&tab=overview), [server](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1225074/mo-secure-share-issue-for-jira-external-share?hosting=server&tab=overview)!**

Jira also has in-built features to share Jira issues with limitations where you could either share your tickets with licensed users,or you’ll have to make your whole project anonymous (that means publicly available over the internet) to externally share your Jira issues or tickets with non-licensed users.

This application tackles perhaps the greatest challenge for the organizations utilizing Jira. Jira admins can share a few Jira cloud tickets of their projects through password protected links to the external users who do not have a Jira account.

### Need of External Share/Secure Share? {#why-is-external-share-needed}

As we are aware that all the Atlassian application licenses (Jira, Confluence etc) are based on the number of users and for a few extra users we have to upgrade to the next user tier increasing the cost overhead on the organization. Now,

- **Envision a situation:** You have a license tier of X users and you want to share your Jira issues or tickets or Confluence pages with your clients or customers for a short period.
- Or with a **set of restrictions** such as view only or editable options.
- Or you just want to **share a particular Jira issue or tickets or Confluence page with users** while restricting them to view other Jira issues or Confluence pages.
- Or **share it with someone outside the instance.**

### How does External Share/Secure Share solve it? {#how-does-secure-share-solve-it}

Let’s look at what we have in our options;

- Upgrade your license tier for creating new users in Jira or Confluence even for a short period.
- Restrict users by assigning them groups and manually removing them each time you want to revoke their privileges to access Jira issues or Confluence pages.
- Create a new Jira project or Confluence space, or assign groups to users each time you want to change the user privileges.
