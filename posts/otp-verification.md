One-time Passwords (as in OTP) are very common to this day. Everyone uses OTPs at various sites during login, registration, transactions on e-commerce sites, and many more things. It is integrated in day to day life so let’s know about it a little more.

### What is One-time Password (OTP)? {#What is One-time Password (OTP)?}

A one-time password (OTP) is a string of characters that authenticates the user and prevents unauthorized use or fraudulent transactions by generating new codes every time it’s used.OTPs are far more secure than static passwords. User-created passwords tend to be weak, and because people reuse them across multiple accounts this makes hackers’ jobs significantly easier. Unlike regular logins which can be used repeatedly and indefinitely by the same individual, an OTP is intended for only one use. OTP also expires after a few minutes.

### Why do we need additional security layers especially OTP in recent times? {#Need additional security layers}

- 1. Defend against password-based attacks
     Passwords created by users can easily be guessed. Cybercriminals find it easier to carry out security assaults to steal passwords such as password sniffing (capturing network traffic and extracting authentication information from it), brute force attacks (in which the attacker guesses all possible combinations of characters in sequence until he finds one that matches) as well as dictionary-based attack. The OTP method of password generation combines numeric and alphanumeric characters in an unexpected way, making it more difficult for thieves to guess passwords.
     
- 2. OTP Validity only for a few minutes
     One-time passwords can only be used for a single verification. It expires in a few minutes. Passwords lose their validity quickly due to time synchronization. In order to complete or retry the transaction after the password has expired, the user must request a new OTP.

- 3. User data validation 
     OTP helps in the authentication of the mobile number or email address of the users which verifies the user’s identity. It reduces the chances of duplicate accounts of the same person during registration/login/feedback forms. It also assists in providing the actual data of users on any site /application.

- 4. Payment Transactions
    Payment transactions are generally used in e-commerce sites, the banking sector, etc. It is necessary to confirm the identity of the person before the initiation of payment.
