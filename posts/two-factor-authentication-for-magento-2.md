Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is also known as two-step verification. In order to gain access to an account or computer system, two-factor authentication requires the user to authenticate themselves using two or more factors.

Users who enable two-factor authentication (2FA) need to provide additional verification factors besides their username and password. It is possible to use second-factor methods such as OTP over SMS, OTP over email, push notifications, Google/Microsoft authenticators, and many more. 

As a result of this additional layer of security, information is well protected from threats like phishing, malware, and hacking. It is critical to ensure a robust identity with strong 2-factor authentication.

In addition to this, the second barrier is also usually more difficult to breach than simple usernames and passwords.

### How does 2fa security work? {#how-does-2fa-security-work}

Your identity is verified by two factors using two-factor authentication (2FA).

**Example 1:** Imagine you have a garage door code (knowledge factor) and a key to your house (possession factor). To enter your locked house through the garage, you need both keys. In this case, two-factor authentication is used because a code and a key are both required. It’s difficult to get through that door without one of them.

In this example, we can see why you should use two-factor authentication to protect your personal information. The one-time verification code is sent to your phone via SMS. If a hacker sets up a keylogger, they can copy your password, but they can’t hack you without your phone.

**Example 2:** During the current pandemic, most businesses are shifting their operations from home, and employees are also working remotely, increasing hacking threats by 20%. The most common method of hacking is through the account login page. You can use two-factor authentication to protect your e-commerce store from all such threats. Through this, you can see why you should use two-factor authentication to protect your organization’s data. For 2FA several methods can be used which are OTP over SMS, OTP Over SMS & Email, Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Duo Push Notification, and many more.

- **Something you know:** your account personal identification number (PIN), or a password.
- **Something you have:** such as a mobile phone or a software application that generates one-time passwords
- **Something you are:** This category is a bit more advanced, and might include a biometric pattern of a fingerprint, voice, or retina.
