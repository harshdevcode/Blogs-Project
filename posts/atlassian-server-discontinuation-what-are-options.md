## Atlassian’s Server License Discontinuation: What are your options? {#atlassian's-server-license-discontinuation}

By now, everyone is aware of Atlassian’s announcement on Server license discontinuation and selling new server license instances from Feb 2, 2021. If you have been living under a rock and missed the announcement, you can check it out here:

**10 – 50 Users:**

With this tier, you will find it easier to just go ahead with Cloud Migration, as upgrading to DC will prove to be a big financial overhead. The basic data security has been taken care of by Atlassian and unless you have stringent security compliance needs, moving to Atlassian Cloud will be a perfect solution for you. There is a free license available as well, although with very limited features. For a smooth transition to cloud migration, we at miniOrange will provide seamless support. You can find out more about Single Sign On for Cloud over at [https://www.miniorange.com/atlassian-cloud-single-sign-on-(sso)]

&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you do have security compliance needs, you can check Atlassian cloud’s security and compliance details here: [https://www.atlassian.com/trust](https://www.atlassian.com/trust). If the compliance you’re looking for is not listed, you should stick to Server for now and raise a request with Atlassian support to know whether it’s in their pipeline and make a decision accordingly.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Our Recommendation: Atlassian Cloud**

### 100 Users {#100-users}
If your users fall into this category and you foresee a rise in their numbers and have strict compliance criteria, there is no better alternative than Atlassian Data Center. However, if you do not need compliances, you might want to consider cloud migration as it would be a cheaper option.

**Our Recommendation: Atlassian Data Center**

### 250 Users and more {#200-users-and-more}
The Data Center will be the best choice for the tier with more users. As the number of users in the cloud increases, it will become expensive. You could also be using a lot of marketplace applications, which are more likely to be available on Atlassian Data Center rather than cloud, so keep that in mind.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Our Recommendation: Atlassian Data Center**


Our suggestion is based on what we believe is best for you, but you are free to think outside the box. Here are a few points to think about when deciding between Cloud and Data Center:

1. What is the user-tier for you? Will it be the same after 1-2 years?
2. Do you want security certifications?
3. What do you have in your budget?
4. Compatibility of Marketplace Apps
5. Storage Requirements
6. Load on applications (using multiple machines to balance the load)

&nbsp;&nbsp;

I hope that this article has helped you recognize the different factors to be considered while migrating and has assisted you in making rational choices.

As a customer-centric Atlassian SSO vendor, we are committed in helping our server customers to who wish to take up Data Center Migration. We will be providing full support and maintenance for all our Server add-ons till 2024.

&nbsp;&nbsp; 

It’s hard to leave until you have to leave. Wishing you a smooth and easy migration.
