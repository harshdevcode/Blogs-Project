### What is Shopify? {#what-is-shopify}

Shopify is one of the world’s most popular eCommerce platforms. It provides merchants with an easy-to-use platform for creating, managing, and customizing their online stores. Shopify recently announced the launch of its new integration with the open-source project [Hydrogen](https://plugins.miniorange.com/shopify-single-sign-on-headless-sso-for-hydrogen). Merchants will be able to easily access and manage their financial data from within their Shopify store’s thanks to this integration.

### What is Hydrogen? {#what-is-hydrogen}

Just when you thought there wouldn’t be another javascript framework, here comes another. This one is called hydrogen, and it’s a react-based framework for building custom e-commerce sites with Shopify. It focuses on server-side rendering, similar to the next. js, but it comes with a slew of predefined components and hooks for managing a storefront’s data and UI.

### What is the point of hydrogen? {#what-is-point-of-hydrogen}

We already have the following. Both js and Gatsby have e-commerce templates, and Shopify already has tons of e-commerce themes. So, where does the hydrogen come in? If you’ve ever built an e-commerce site from scratch, you’ll know how difficult it is, which is why platforms like Shopify, Big Commerce, and Square Space are so popular.

At the same time, when you use a platform like that, your site tends to feel like a cookie-cutter template, and it can be difficult to customize it enough to break out of that. The cool thing about Shopify is that it has a graphQL API that allows you to use it without a browser. So, in essence, hydrogen provides a streamlined method for quickly launching a server-rendered frontend app that connects to your Shopify backend. In other words, it serves as a foundation for creating fully customizable storefronts.

### What exactly is Headless eCommerce on Shopify? {Why-should-you-go-for-Shopify-Headless-Services}

Merchants will be able to access the Hydrogen API and its financial services directly from their Shopify stores thanks to the integration. This means that merchants can now integrate their financial data into their Shopify stores quickly and easily. Merchants can provide their customers with a more secure and convenient way to pay for their purchases by integrating with Hydrogen. Hydrogen services can also be used by merchants to track and monitor the performance of their financial products. The integration with Hydrogen is an excellent way for merchants to provide their customers with an improved shopping experience.

The front end and back end of a website are separated in a headless commerce solution’s architecture. Simply put, Shopify’s headless services separate an online store’s web storefront from its backend. The two layers will operate independently and communicate through APIs, giving the front end more customization options.

**For all of your eCommerce needs, Shopify offers features like:**

- Checkout is mobile-friendly and supports a variety of payment methods, including Apple Pay.

- Advanced system for managing orders and inventory.

- Applications that are easy to download from the app store.

You might discover that some functionality or design options become less customizable as your business expands. However, over time you might come to realize that the Shopify storefront is insufficient for your needs.

**You can use Shopify headless to accomplish the following objectives**

- You have more say in how your products are displayed.

- The website and web page load quickly.

- Greater adaptability and simpler content administration.

  Enhancing the capabilities of web stores, and headless opens up new possibilities. It significantly increases speed over the previous method and offers excellent user experiences based on a variety of data sources.

### How does Single Sign-On (SSO) login work for Headless stores in Shopify? {#How-Single-Sign-On-SSO-login-work-for-headless-store }

Recently, Shopify added Hydrogen SSO as a new feature to their platform. With the help of this single sign-on (SSO) solution, retailers can access their Shopify stores from any location and on any device. Customers can log into their accounts with just one set of credentials thanks to Hydrogen SSO. Merchants can easily access their stores from any device, wherever they are, by using a single set of credentials. Having to remember numerous usernames and passwords for each store is made easier thanks to this.

The miniOrange SSO App connects to any Identity Provider that supports Standard Authentication Protocols such as SAML 2.0, OAuth 2.0, JWT, LDAP, and others. We enable users to authenticate and SSO into any Headless website built on Shopify Hydrogen or any Frontend technology such as React JS, Angular JS, Flutter, Gatsby, or Vue. The app receives the Identity provider’s response and sends a JWT token back to the headless website or the hydrogen framework-based store.
