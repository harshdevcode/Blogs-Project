### What is Privileged Account Management? {#what-is-privileged-account-management}

**Privileged Account Management (PAM)** is a process that focuses on managing and securing [privileged accounts](https://www.miniorange.com/blog/what-are-privileged-accounts/) that get access to sensitive servers within an organization's IT environment. It consists of various roles such as granting permissions, making modifications to sensitive data, in simple words who can unlock a system, get access to the system and also take a look at what is inside the IT ecosystem. 

**Privileged accounts** are accounts that have elevated access rights, allowing users to perform critical and sensitive tasks, such as system administration, configuration changes, and access to sensitive data. The privileged account management solution aims to control, monitor, and audit these privileged accounts to ensure that access is granted only to authorized users and for approved activities. Through Privileged Account Management, organizations can reduce the risk of unauthorized access, insider threats, and potential data breaches, while also meeting compliance requirements and enhancing overall cybersecurity.

Privileged Account Management is essential for organizations to protect against cyberattacks that target privileged accounts. If these accounts are compromised, attackers can freely move within the network, conducting harmful actions like downloading malicious files, taking control of servers, and causing financial loss and damage to the organization's reputation. PAM helps prevent such risks and ensures the security of the privileged account.

### What is a Privileged Account? {#what-is-a-privileged-account} 

A Privileged Account, also known as an elevated account, is a powerful and essential type of account in an IT environment. It serves as the foundation for managing organizational resources, including hardware and software. Privileged accounts encompass various types, such as Linux/Unix root accounts, Windows Administrator, Database Administrator (DBA), and various application accounts. These accounts hold significant permissions, allowing IT teams to perform critical tasks like setting up architecture, running essential applications and services, installing software, and overseeing software maintenance tasks. Essentially, privileged accounts act as master keys, providing access to critical IT assets and sensitive information within an organization.

Due to their elevated privileges, privileged accounts are high-value targets for cyber attackers, emphasizing the importance of robust security and management practices, such as [granular access control](https://www.miniorange.com/pam/granular-access-control) and [zero trust](https://www.miniorange.com/blog/zero-trust-security-model/), to protect the organization's IT environment.

#### Types of Privileged Accounts

- **Linux/Unix Root Accounts**: These pam accounts have the highest level of access in Unix-like systems.
- **Windows Administrator Accounts**: These accounts have complete control over the Windows environment.
- **Database Administrator (DBA) Accounts**: These privileged accounts manage and maintain database systems.
- **Application Accounts**: These accounts are used by applications to access databases and other services.

The management of these privileged accounts is crucial to ensuring the security and integrity of the IT infrastructure. PAM account solutions play an important role in controlling and monitoring access, ensuring that only authorized personnel can perform critical operations.

### How to manage Privileged Accounts? {#how-to-manage-privileged-accounts} 

Usually, organizations use various password management software to help employees maintain their credentials for their applications. This approach requires a bit of attention while employees choose and manage their passwords effectively. 
In todayâ€™s times, companies are moving forward with their password management and security practices. To accomplish this, robust privileged account and access management solutions must be deployed efficiently. Therefore, privileged account management tools enable your company to improve password protection and strengthen privileged account security overall.

To effectively manage privileged accounts, follow these steps for the PAM Lifecycle:


1. **Define and Classify Privileged Accounts**: Begin by defining and classifying privileged accounts. Your business functions rely on data, systems, and access, and dependence on these entities varies from one organization to another. Consult your disaster recovery plan, which typically classifies your critical systems, and align your privileged accounts to your business risk and operations. Develop IT security policies that explicitly cover privileged accounts, detailing acceptable use and responsibilities.
2. **Discover Privileged Accounts**: Use an automated privileged account discovery tool to identify and locate all these accounts in your IT environment. This will give you a comprehensive understanding of how many such accounts you have and where they are located. Continuous discovery helps curb privileged account sprawl, identify potential insider abuse, and reveal external threats. This step is crucial in the PAM Lifecycle.
3. **Manage and Protect Privileged Accounts**: Protect your pam account passwords by proactively managing, monitoring, and controlling its access with password protection software. Ensure your password management solution can automatically discover and store credentials; schedule password rotation; audit, analyze, and manage individual privileged account session activity; and monitor password accounts to detect and respond to malicious activity proactively. Develop a least privilege policy to limit IT admin access to systems, granting privileges only when required and approved. Effective PAM implementation includes robust management and protection strategies.
4. **Monitor and Record Privileged Account Activity**: Your Privileged Access Management solution should monitor and record privileged account activity. This helps enforce proper behavior and avoid user mistakes because users know their activities are being monitored. Monitoring also aids digital forensics in identifying the root cause of breaches and critical controls that can be improved to reduce future cybersecurity threats. Monitoring is a key component of the PAM Lifecycle.
5. **Detect Abnormal Usage**: Track and alert on user behavior. Up to 80% of breaches involve a compromised user or privileged account. Gain insights into privileged account access and user behavior in real-time to catch suspected account compromises and potential user abuse. Behavioral analytics establish individual user baselines, including user activity, password access, similar user behavior, and time of access, to identify and alert on suspicious activity.
6. **Respond to Incidents**: Prepare an incident response plan in case a pam account is compromised. Simply changing privileged account passwords or disabling them is not adequate when a privileged account is breached. Assume that if a domain administrator account is compromised, your entire Active Directory is also compromised. Follow a comprehensive incident response plan to address such breaches effectively. Incident response is a critical stage in the PAM Lifecycle.
7. **Review and Audit Privileged Account Activity**: Continuously monitor privileged account usage via audits and reports to identify unusual behaviors, which may indicate a breach or misuse. Automated reports help track the cause of security incidents and demonstrate compliance with policies and regulations. Privileged account audits provide essential cybersecurity metrics and vital information for executive decision-making. Regular reviews and audits are integral to successful PAM implementation.


By following these steps and embracing the PAM Lifecycle approach, you can strengthen the security of your privileged accounts and ensure effective management of these critical assets. 



### Privileged Account Management vs Privileged Access Management {#privileged-account-management-vs-privileged-access-management} 

The difference between Privileged Account Management (PAM) and Privileged Access Management (PAM) lies in their scope and focus:

**1. Privileged Account Management (PAM):**

Privileged Account Management specifically deals with the management and security of privileged accounts within an organization's IT environment. It focuses on managing and controlling the access rights and permissions of accounts that have elevated privileges, such as administrative accounts, root Linux/Unix accounts, and database administrator accounts. The main objective of it is to ensure that privileged accounts are properly protected, monitored, and audited to prevent unauthorized access and reduce the risk of security breaches.

**2. Privileged Access Management (PAM):**

Privileged Access Management, on the other hand, encompasses a broader approach that goes beyond just managing privileged accounts. It involves managing and securing all aspects of privileged access within an organization, including not only privileged accounts but also privileged access to applications, systems, databases, and other critical resources. PAM focuses on implementing comprehensive strategies and technologies to control and monitor elevated access and permissions, minimizing the attack surface and enhancing overall security.
