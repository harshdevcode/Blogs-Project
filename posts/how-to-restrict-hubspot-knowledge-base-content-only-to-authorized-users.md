### Features provided by miniOrange HubSpot SSO : {#miniorange-hubspot-sso-features}

**- Multiple IdP Support :** Multiple Identity Provider (IdP) support in a single sign-on (SSO) refers to the ability of an SSO system to authenticate users through multiple IdPs. This means that a user can log into a single application or a set of applications using different IdPs, without having to enter their credentials multiple times.

For example, a user may have an account with Google, Facebook, KeyCloak, JumpCloud, OneLogin, and Microsoft. If a company has an SSO system in place with support for multiple IdPs, the user can log into the company’s applications using any of their Google, Facebook, or Microsoft accounts, or any other IdP.

Additionally, **multiple IdP support** can also provide a level of security, as it allows organizations to use multiple authentication mechanisms and choose the most secure option for their needs. For example, an organization may choose to use Google for consumer-level applications and Microsoft for business-critical applications, to ensure that the most secure authentication method is used for sensitive data.
