How can you avoid this? The answer is simple: “Using [WordPress Single Sign-On (SSO)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/miniorange-login-with-eve-online-google-facebook/) Plugin”.

### What is Single Sign-On(SSO)? {#what-is-sso}

[Single Sign-On (SSO)](https://www.miniorange.com/products/single-sign-on-sso) is a feature that enables users to login into an E-commerce store much faster and without creating new credentials for the specific site. Users have to remember just one credential for logging in to the E-commerce platform. For eg., Users can log in to your E-commerce store using any IDPs like Google, Facebook, Yahoo, etc.


### Freedom from multiple passwords:  {#ecommerce-multiple-passwords}

Using E-commerce Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication, users can get access to all authorized resources with just one click. Users do not have to be dependent on remembering Username, password, or any other credentials. Users can use just one IDP to login into all other accounts. This also improves the security of the E-commerce store as no data will be stored locally instead it will be saved safely with trusted IDPs.

### Data collection: {#data-collection}

Nowadays Single Sign-On (SSO) is provided by most E-commerce stores. Why? Because it brings lots of benefits for E-commerce sites and users. 


### What Are the Advantages of WordPress E-commerce Single Sign-On (SSO) for a User? {#advantages-of-sso}

Single Sign-On (SSO) improves the user experience of your store because the users don’t have to create a new account from scratch to access your E-commerce store. All they need is an already created account which allows them to use the credentials of that application to login into your application. Most people prefer Single Sign-On (SSO) because it saves time and is easy to use. Moreover, this allows users to change one password to all the accounts. This can also be used to change other information like Name, Age, Address, Personal data, Phone and many more. 

E-commerce Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication also assures users that their data is securely stored in one place. Using Single Sign-On (SSO) assures users that no sensitive data is transferred and only the essential information and identity of the user will be shared with the external application.

### Why is it the Best Time to Implement WordPress Single Sign-On (SSO) for Your E-Commerce Store? {#best-time-for-sso}

1.)**Consumers expect SSO:** In the current scenario, customers are expecting SSO in every E-commerce store available because it saves their time and they don’t have to remember multiple credentials. If you have a service that requires logging in before accessing anything then Single sign-on (SSO) is a must if you don’t want to annoy your customers.

2.)**SSO improves conversion rate:** Single sign-on (SSO) makes the E-commerce store user-friendly which leads to easy navigation. This reduces the hassle the customer has to go through while logging in or creating a new account. This indirectly allows customers to log in faster which increases the conversion rate.

3.)**SSO cuts down churn rate:** Some users log in frequently but Users who do not log in frequently have a chance to forget their credentials. If they lose or forget their password there is a good chance that they will not return back. This increases the churn rate and affects the business. SSO enables those customers to return back seamlessly without remembering the credentials.
