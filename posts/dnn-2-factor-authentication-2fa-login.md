## DNN Two Factor Authentication Plugin – DNN 2FA 

### What is two-factor authentication? {#what is two-factor authentication}
Two-factor authentication(2FA) or two-step verification, keeps your DNN website protected by applying an additional layer of security apart from your username and password.
There can be the following categories of [Two-factor authentications:](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-101/what-is-two-factor-authentication-2fa)-

**1.Knowledge-based authentication** – something that you know like password and security questions, PIN, etc.

**2.Possession-based authentication** – something you have like your phone, secure USB key, etc.

### How does two-factor authentication work? {#How does two-factor authentication work}
When you are logging into your DNN site, you are required to enter your login credentials, traditionally, it is “username and password” to authenticate yourself. But, if you have two-factor authentication enabled on your DNN site then you will be doubly authenticated. After you have entered your login credentials you will be required to provide a 2FA passcode to gain access.

### Why is two-factor authentication important for website security? {#Why is two-factor authentication important for website security}
Securing your DNN account, only with a username and password is less than reassuring in today’s scenario, where automated password guessing, brute force attacks, dictionary attacks, and endless other threats are quite commonplace. In a world where the most used passwords still are 123456 and QWERTY, we need no further study and data to admit that remembering passwords is a headache for most users. This password fatigue leads them to use the same passwords across multiple accounts which can jeopardize the security of all websites due to a single password hack.

### What could happen even if we keep strong passwords. {#What could happen even if we keep strong passwords}
Even if users are aware and responsible enough to use strong passwords, social engineering attacks like phishing and spear phishing are employed which dupe users into divulging their login credentials. Users can end up entering their username and password into manipulated URLs that look like genuine websites or installing keystroke recorders and other similar kinds of spyware that leave not even a strong password hard to crack.

These security threats will have far-reaching ramifications if not tackled properly. These will potentially compromise your digital security.

If you have two-factor authentication enabled at your site, a compromised password is not something you will have to think about twice.
