### Why do I need to secure my Atlassian suite with Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)? {#why-to-secure-my-atlassian-apps-with-casb}

The Atlassian App Suite is widely adopted for documentation and team collaboration to create project lifecycle management. All users can enter their activities and task progress, manage customer issues, and get a transparent view of the end-to-end deployment of a project. So all Atlassian apps in use stand as a haven for storing organized data related to every project and how an organization will boost productivity and streamline processes to meet deadlines.

With the [closing of the Atlassian Server](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/marketplace/knowledge-base/end-of-sale-and-support-for-server-apps/), the only available options for customers are now Data Center (DC) and Atlassian Cloud. Data Center is an expensive option and most users cannot switch to DC, hence they have no other choice but to move to Atlassian Cloud. But using Cloud has its set of disadvantages. The most important point, is the lack of data security compliance and potential threats of security breaches, leading to a lack of trust in Jira Cloud security and Confluence compliance.

With Atlassian CASB for Jira and Confluence, you can achieve cloud compliances like ITAR, FERPA and HIPAA, along with security breach prevention protocols and gain insights with threat reports to safeguard your Atlassian suite, data and get Jira Cloud and Confluence security.

Without Atlassian CASB for Jira and Confluence, there is a clear threat of data breaches and security risks, where an employee could copy and leak data outside the company to third-party services. Without a CASB solution, you cannot get deep visibility into the Atlassian app activity and will never find out the source of the data breach. This emerging threat and concern for data security is why you need to use a [CASB solutions](https://www.miniorange.com/casb/solutions/) with all your Atlassian Cloud App Suite.

Let’s see how a Cloud Access Security Broker works for Jira and Confluence compliance to prevent data infringement and provide Atlassian suite security.

### How does a CASB secure Atlassian Apps for teams? {#how-does-casb-secures-atlassian-apps}

Here’s how a [Cloud Access Security Broker](https://www.miniorange.com/blog/what-are-the-4-pillars-of-casb/) works to secure your Atlassian SaaS Apps to provide Jira Cloud and Confluence security.

Let’s say a company is using Atlassian Cloud for its project planning and team collaboration.

The company has 2 user groups, the support team and the analytics team, that have access to the Jira Tickets service. The support team will need to access the customer information stored on the tickets to understand what products the customer is using. The analytics team, on the other hand, will also need to export the customer data from the Jira Tickets service to gather insights.

Let’s say there are 2 users, Jeremey from the Support team and Noah from the analytics team.

Jeremy does have access to the customer’s Jira Tickets to check which products the customer has purchased and support them accordingly. But if he tries to export the data, the CASB solution will deny him from performing the action.

When Noah, from the analytics team, tries to export the same Jira Tickets dashboard he will be able to export the customer data for his analytics team and work on it.

This way, the miniOrange Atlassian CASB solution will provide role-based access to the different solutions on the Atlassian App suite for Jira and Confluence security. Additionally, you also get deep visibility into the traffic on your Atlassian app usage for the Security Operations Center to gain deeper insights into potential security threats targeted towards their Atlassian apps.
