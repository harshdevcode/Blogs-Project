### What are Atlassian apps? {#what-are-atlassian-apps}

Atlassian apps include all the apps that are published on the Atlassian marketplace. These apps work on the cloud or data center along with all your Jira apps and Confluence apps.

Jira is a complete suite of productivity apps used for submitting issues, tracking tickets, maintaining workflows, automating recurrent tasks, project progress tracking, and a lot more used by companies daily to drive project growth. Jira apps were foundationally built by keeping the principles of Agile Methodology intact.

Confluence is a solution for creating a shared workspace and for teams to collectively come together and collaborate on a project. It provides an environment with complete user transparency, workflow management, collaboration done by each user, and an understanding of the project’s growth over time.

There are a bunch of apps in the Atlassian suite. Here’s a list of all the Jira and Confluence apps with a short description for each.

-   Jira Service Desk: Jira Service Desk is a platform to receive issues from customers and track customer lifecycles from querying to deploying the solution with all the paperwork and request queuing.

-   Jira Core: Jira Core is a highly organized workflow project, where all teams can create a step-by-step process to complete tasks on time. They are highly versatile and can be used by all departments within an organization.

-   Jira Software: Jira software utilizes the power of Kanban and Agile methodologies, to build project sprints, list issues, create backlog items, task completion and velocity, and visually depict the team’s progress.

-   Bitbucket: Bitbucket is an on-premise Git repository management software for all team members to collaborate on projects and is the top competitor for the Microsoft-owned GitHub.

-   Confluence: Confluence is a document collaboration tool for teams to keep records of a research topic or share steps to configure a standard software tool to promote transparency within the team.

-   Statuspage: Statuspage lets the customers know about scheduled downtime for maintenance of the application to prevent sudden crashes.

It stands as an **“Incident Management Messenger”** between you and your end users.

-   Opsgenie: Opsgenie helps your developer teams and operations teams stay on top of threat alerts and incidents and control the situation in real-time.

### Why do I need to secure my Atlassian apps with Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)? {#why-to-secure-my-atlassian-apps-with-casb}

The Atlassian App Suite is widely adopted for documentation and team collaboration to create project lifecycle management. All users can enter their activities and task progress, manage customer issues, and get a transparent view of the end-to-end deployment of a project. So all Atlassian apps in use stand as a haven for storing organized data related to every project and how an organization will boost productivity and streamline processes to meet deadlines.

With the closing of the Atlassian Server, the only available options for customers are now Data Center (DC) and Atlassian Cloud. Data Center is an expensive option and most users cannot switch to DC, hence they have no other choice but to move to Atlassian Cloud. But using Cloud has its set of disadvantages. The most important point, is the lack of data security compliance and potential threats of security breaches, leading to a lack of trust in Jira Cloud and Confluence security.

With Atlassian Cloud Acces Security Broker (CASB), you can achieve all cloud compliance requirements along with security breach prevention protocols and gain insights with threat reports to safeguard your Atlassian SaaS apps data and get Jira Cloud and Confluence security.

Without Atlassian CASB, there is a clear threat of data breaches and security risks, where an employee could copy and leak data outside the company to third-party services. Without a CASB solution, you cannot get deep visibility into the Atlassian app activity and will never find out the source of the data breach. This emerging threat and concern for data security is why you need to use a CASB solution with all your Atlassian Cloud App Suite.

Let’s see how a Cloud Access Security Broker works for compliance on your Atlassian SaaS apps to prevent data infringement and provide Jira Cloud and Confluence security.

### How does a CASB secure Atlassian Apps for teams? {#how-does-casb-secures-atlassian-apps}

Here’s how a Cloud Access Security Broker works to secure your Atlassian SaaS Apps to provide Jira Cloud and Confluence security.

Let’s say a company is using Atlassian Cloud for its project planning and team collaboration.

The company has 2 user groups, the support team and the analytics team, that have access to the Jira Tickets service. The support team will need to access the customer information stored on the tickets to understand what products the customer is using. The analytics team, on the other hand, will also need to export the customer data from the Jira Tickets service to gather insights.

Let’s say there are 2 users, Jeremey from the Support team and Noah from the analytics team.

Jeremy does have access to the customer’s Jira Tickets to check which products the customer has purchased and support them accordingly. But if he tries to export the data, the CASB solution will deny him from performing the action.

When Noah, from the analytics team, tries to export the same Jira Tickets dashboard he will be able to export the customer data for his analytics team and work on it.

This way, the miniOrange Atlassian CASB solution will provide role-based access to the different solutions on the Atlassian App suite for Jira and Confluence security. Additionally, you also get deep visibility into the traffic on your Atlassian app usage for the Security Operations Center to gain deeper insights into potential security threats targeted towards their Atlassian apps.
