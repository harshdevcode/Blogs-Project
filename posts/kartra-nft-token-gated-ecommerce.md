###  What is crypto wallet login? {#cryptowallet}

Crypto wallet login is a security method where the users **connect their crypto wallets in use to authorize login to Kartra**. With this method, if a user holds a specific NFT from a collection, only then will they be allowed to access sections or subsections of a Kartra site.

NFT Token Gating (also known as token-gated commerce) allows only those users who hold a specific NFT from an NFT Collection (or a specific number of NFTs) to navigate to a site path.
