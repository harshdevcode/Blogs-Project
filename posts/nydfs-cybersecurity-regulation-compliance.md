### What is the 23 NYCRR Part 500? {#what-is-the-23-nycrr-part-500}
The[ NYDFS CyberSecurity Regulation Guidelines](https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/Cybersecurity_Requirements_Financial_Services_23NYCRR500.pdf), released on March 1 2017, are a set of regulations from the New York Department of Financial Services that places new cybersecurity requirements on financial institutions. These new guidelines under 23 NYCRR Part 500 affected licensed lenders, state-chartered banks, trust companies, service contract providers, private bankers, mortgage companies, insurance firms doing business in New York, non-U.S. banks licensed to operate in New York, and many other organizations, which now have to comply with these additional Cybersecurity Requirements.  

These NYDFS Cybersecurity guidelines focus more on a cybersecurity program risk assessment which determines an entity’s best practices and policies to mitigate security risks. Identity and Access Management (IAM) in the form of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or equivalent measures, is now required by the NYDFS. Specifically, section 500.1 defines MFA as follows:  

“Multi-Factor Authentication means authentication through verification of at least two of the following types of authentication factors: (1) Knowledge factors, such as a password; or (2) Possession factors, such as a token or text message on a mobile phone; or (3) Inherence factors, such as a biometric characteristic.”  

Additional sections that are pertinent to effective IAM include:  
“Risk-Based Authentication means any risk-based system of authentication that detects anomalies or changes in the normal use patterns of a Person and requires additional verification of the Person’s identity when such deviations or changes are detected, such as through the use of challenge questions.”  

NYDFS also describes how each Covered Entity needs to implement and maintain cybersecurity regulation policies. One of the areas explicitly covered as part of the cybersecurity policies relates to access controls and identity management. Covered Entities must prove they have effective IAM measures in place to eliminate or reduce unauthorized access to sensitive information by hackers, phishers, insiders, or third parties.  

According to these new cybersecurity guidelines by the NYDFS, IAM becomes the most important factor to protect huge customer and business information. So implementing MFA, Lifecycle Management and other solutions can help organizations to ensure that they comply with these new guidelines.

 

### Why is 23 NYCRR Part 500 needed? {#why-is-23-nycrr-part-500-needed}
To prevent data breaches, cyber security threats & unauthorized access. These cybersecurity guidelines help organizations secure their environment from different cyber security threats to protect all types of data.
