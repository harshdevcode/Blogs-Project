[**Store migration**](https://plugins.miniorange.com/shopify-ecommerce-store-migration) is the process of moving data such as products, orders, customers, collections, images, manufacturers, etc. from one eCommerce platform to another.

Your online store is getting bigger but its eCommerce website just cannot keep pace with the growth. Is it too slow and too expensive or too complex or lacks the features to keep your customers happy and coming back? You don’t have to stick with it and don’t have to start from scratch either. If you’re thinking about migrating your eCommerce store to a new platform, consider **Shopify. Shopify** is a great platform and has a lot of benefits that you will see later. You can use the miniOrange Store migration application to migrate your eCommerce website to Shopify. Using this application you can easily migrate your entire store, all your products, customers, orders, and everything from any eCommerce website over to Shopify within minutes.

### How to Migrate to Shopify? {#how-to-migrate-to-shopify}
In general, there are three methods by which you can migrate your eCommerce website to Shopify. 
1. You can import and export the data manually from your eCommerce website to your Shopify store and vice versa. It may appear simple because you just have to copy the data from the source store and paste it into the target store. This mode might be acceptable until hundreds of data points have been collected.
2. You can hire a developer to migrate the data from your eCommerce website to the Shopify store but considering the cost of hiring an expert, it is not the best option available.
3. You can go for an automated store migration service such as a miniOrange Store migration application. Automated eCommerce migration is a cutting-edge method for both web developers and newcomers who want to run their businesses while online converters do all of the work for them.

4. **Migrate Source Store categories into collections on Shopify:**
During the migration process,  using this feature you can migrate all of your categories including sub-categories to Shopify collections.

5.  **Re-migration:**
We recommend you to use the re-migration feature if there has been some issue in setting up the source cart or target cart or some fields, the migrated data is corrupted before and after the migration, and many other reasons like that. In such cases, you can request miniOrange to start the migration all over again.
