## What is Single Sign On (SSO)? {#what-is-sso}

Imagine having a single key that unlocks all doors. Single Sign-On works similarly for websites and popular apps. Using SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) technology, SSO allows you to use just one set of login details to open all your websites without needing to remember multiple details for each. This makes it easier and quicker for you and your website visitors to access all the things they need without the hassle of logging in separately each time. This not only saves time but also makes it incredibly easy to manage your online accounts securely.

### How [SAML SSO](https://plugins.miniorange.com/wordpress-single-sign-on-sso) Secures WordPress Sites? {#how-saml-sso-secures-wp-site}

Using SAML Single Sign On (SSO) can make accessing your WordPress site simpler and a lot safer.

Here's how:

&nbsp;

#### **Say Goodbye to Remembering Passwords**

We've all been there — trying to remember which password we used for a particular site. SAML Single Sign On cuts down on the need to remember all your passwords. Since users only need one set of credentials, they're less likely to pick easy-to-guess passwords or use the same password everywhere. This means users get the freedom to set complex and hard-to-hack passwords without the worry of remembering them, ensuring both security and ease.

&nbsp;

#### **Centralized Security For All Websites**

Similar to a security center where guards verify IDs before granting access to someone in a building, [WordPress SSO](https://plugins.miniorange.com/wordpress-single-sign-on-sso) serves as a central location for user identity verification. When users log in via Single Sign On solutions, their identities are confirmed, and they can access other connected services without having to verify their identities again.

&nbsp;

#### **Simplified User Login Process**  

Nobody likes to fill out long forms or remember another password. SSO makes the login process fast and simple, which means happier users, enhanced security, and fewer headaches for everyone involved. With Single Sign On solutions, users can focus on the tasks they need to complete instead of spending time and effort remembering different login credentials.

&nbsp;

#### **Boost Your Login Security**  

Most Identity Providers support [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](https://www.miniorange.com/products/multi-factor-authentication-mfa) which can add an extra security layer to your WordPress SSO solution. It’s like a second lock on your door, which means even if someone gets your key (password), they still can't get in without the second lock's key.

&nbsp;

#### **Easy User Provisioning & De-Provisioning**  

Single Sign On simplifies the process of granting or removing new users/customers access to a WordPress website using its [SCIM User Provisioning](https://plugins.miniorange.com/wordpress-user-provisioning) feature. This helps keep the WordPress site secure by ensuring only the right people can get in.


### Wrapping Up {#wrapping-up}

SAML SSO offers a win-win for WordPress site owners and users alike — it simplifies logging in while providing a solid boost to security.
