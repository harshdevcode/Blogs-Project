### Why is Thinkific popular among users? {#why-is-thinkific-popular-among-users?}
Thinkific provides a platform that allows businesses or people to create and deliver online courses without any design or technical expertise. It allows its users to use their existing resources to set up online courses using an easy-to-use interface. Thinkific offers tools for setting up courses, managing students, payments, and marketing to reach a bigger audience. It’s a one-stop-shop for all your Online Course needs.  

Typical customers of Thinkific are Freelancers, Small businesses, Mid-size businesses, and large enterprises and to provide them with more exclusive and various features- Thinkific provides [3rd party applications](https://apps.thinkific.com/) which can be configured and installed to your Thinkific Website to deliver the best experience for students and online education.  

Not providing an interface to use existing user sessions or credentials leads to a bad user experience as users have to remember and enter credentials each time they want to access their applications, this is where [SSO for Education](https://www.miniorange.com/iam/solutions/identity-management-for-k12) comes into the picture. [Single Sign-On (SSO)](https://www.miniorange.com/thinkific-jwt-single-signon(sso)-solution) is an authentication service that allows a user to access multiple applications (such as [Microsoft Apps](https://www.miniorange.com/iam/integrations/microsoft-365-sso), [Google Apps](https://www.miniorange.com/google-apps-single-sign-on-(sso)), [Oracle EBS](https://www.miniorange.com/iam/integrations/oracle-single-sign-on-sso), and many more)  using a single set of credentials. This prevents the need for the user to log in separately into the different applications. Using SSO the end user only has to remember one set of credentials to access all the applications. Users can be anywhere, in miniOrange, any external IDPs ( such as Azure AD, Okta, etc ), or in any user directory such as AD, LDAP, etc and they don’t have to migrate their credentials.  

In addition to [SSO](https://www.miniorange.com/blog/what-is-single-sign-on-sso/), users will have one-click access to all their apps and will never be locked out by mistake. On top of SSO, [Two-Factor authentication](https://www.miniorange.com/two-factor-authentication-(2fa)) makes it easier for users and organizations to safeguard and prevent security breaches as it adds an extra layer of security to their applications.

### Challenges faced by Thinkific Users {#challenges-faced-by-thinkific-users}
Since the internet has become a crucial part of schools and educational institutes, it is now a challenge for these institutes to manage logins for such a large number of users, whether it be Thinkific or any other online platform.  

Schools or colleges usually have an existing application/site where student credentials are already stored. Now to log into Thinkific or any other online app, students want seamless access to their app portal through their existing accounts. Students do not wish to have a separate set of credentials for logging into Thinkific.  

Now to overcome this problem, Thinkific allows its users to use their existing credentials to log in to their Thinkific platform using JWT (JSON Web Token). An interface needs to be created by administrators to generate that JWT token and log the users into Thinkific using their existing credentials. Administrators don’t always have the control or the resources to generate such an interface.
