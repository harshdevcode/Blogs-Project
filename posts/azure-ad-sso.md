## Why Azure AD SSO is Important for Modern Enterprises? {#why-is-azure-ad-important}

The workforce of modern enterprises often faces the challenge of managing multiple applications and systems, each requiring separate login credentials. This exposes their employees to more frustration, less productivity, and higher security risks. To address these challenges, [Single Sign-On (SSO)](https://www.miniorange.com/products/single-sign-on-sso) using existing Azure AD emerges as a critical solution for modern-day organizations.

### What is Azure AD Single Sign On (SSO)? {#what-is-azure-ad-sso}

Azure AD is a popular directory used by most enterprises to store their data, applications, user information, etc. **Azure AD Single Sign-On (SSO)** is a cloud-based authentication service provided by Microsoft, which allows users to securely access multiple applications and resources within the Active Directory using a single set of login credentials. 

With Azure AD SSO, your employees authenticate themselves once and gain seamless access to various applications they require, without the need to provide credentials again for each individual application. This saves time and increases productivity. With fewer passwords to manage, this mode of authentication increases safety and significantly lowers password theft threats.

Azure AD SSO leverages industry-standard protocols such as Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) or OpenID Connect to establish trust between the identity provider (Azure AD) and the applications. When a user attempts to access an application, Azure handles the authentication process behind the scenes in the backend, validating the user's identity and providing the necessary access tokens to the application.

### 3 Reasons Why Enterprises Should Implement Azure AD SSO {#3-reasons-to-implement-azure-ad-sso}

**1.Simply the User Experience:** The seamless login process provided by Azure AD SSO eliminates the need for users to remember and enter multiple login credentials, saving time and increasing productivity.

**2.Enable Centralized Identity Management:** When Azure AD SSO is implemented, Azure AD serves as a centralized identity management hub, streamlining the user provisioning, de-provisioning, and access control, improving operational efficiency.

**3.Say Bye to Password Management:** Password-related problems are eliminated when users can log in to multiple apps with a single set of credentials via Single Sign-On. Hence, there is no need to manage multiple passwords for different apps.

### How to Enable SSO For Apps Not Supporting SAML Protocol? {#sso-for-apps-that-dont-support-saml}  
With [Azure AD SSO integration](https://www.miniorange.com/iam/login-with-external-idp/configure-azure-ad-sso#step2), SSO can be enabled for applications that support SAML & Open ID protocols, but many organizations use applications that do not support any SSO Protocol or use something else for delegated authentication. For such unique use cases, miniOrange’s Proprietary Azure AD SSO solution is the perfect solution. 

### Easy SSO Deployment with miniOrange {#easy-sso-deployment-with-miniorange}

[miniOrange solution](https://www.miniorange.com/products/identity-broker-service) works like a third-party provider, where it keeps the Azure AD as IDP and enables SSO for all applications. In case the app does not support SAML, but supports other standard protocols, then to enable SSO, miniOrange can act as a middleman to facilitate communication between Azure AD and your application by converting SAML responses to app-specific protocol responses that the app can easily understand. If the application doesn't support any known protocols, then **miniOrange provides custom solutions** (like Connectors, etc.) to enable SSO. miniOrange also provides APIs that developers can easily integrate with the respective applications for authentication or authorization.

### User & Group Sync between Azure AD and any Databases/IDPs {#user-and-group-sync}

With [miniOrange User & Group Sync](https://www.miniorange.com/azure-ad-provisioning) admins can effectively synchronize user and group data stored in Azure AD with any external directories, IDPs, and applications. This eliminates the need for manual user and group creation and enables the syncing of custom attributes across different places. The sync can be scheduled or executed manually, significantly reducing administrative time and minimizing errors. Its seamless integration is invaluable for efficient user management. miniOrange can create, read, and update user accounts for new or existing users, remove accounts for deactivated users, and synchronize attributes across **multiple databases, IDPs, directories, and the applications** that the user needs access to.

### 5 Reasons Why Organizations Should Implement Azure AD SSO Via miniOrange  {#5-reasons-to-choose-miniorange-azure-ad-sso}   

1. **Multi-Platform Support:** The miniOrange solution for Azure AD SSO offers broad support for a wide range of platforms, applications, and protocols, allowing organizations to enable SSO across various systems, both cloud-based and on-premises. Also, there is a range of **pre-built integrations and connectors** for popular enterprise applications, simplifying the SSO implementation process.
2. **Ease of Use and Configuration:** For configuration processes to SSO, you can leverage miniOrange’s user-friendly interfaces to make the process streamlined. Get comprehensive administration consoles with intuitive workflows, making it easier for administrators to set up and manage SSO for the entire organization.
3. **Identity Management Features:** miniOrange offers advanced [identity management capabilities](https://www.miniorange.com/iam/workforce-identity) beyond SSO. These include features such as user provisioning and de-provisioning, [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA),](https://www.miniorange.com/products/multi-factor-authentication-mfa) password management, directory integration, and detailed access controls. These additional features can enhance security and streamline user management processes.
4. **Flexibility and Customization:** While Azure AD offers SSO capabilities, miniOrange generally provides more flexibility and customization options by offering **extensive API support, developer tools, and customization capabilities,** allowing organizations to tailor their SSO implementation to specific business requirements and integrate with custom applications.
5. **Third-Party Integration Ecosystem:** miniOrange has well-established ecosystems with a wide range of third-party integrations.

### FAQ {#faq}

**1. What is Azure AD SAML SSO?**  
SAML is an XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between identity providers (such as Azure AD) and service providers (applications). Azure AD SAML SSO (Security Assertion Markup Language Single Sign-On) is a specific implementation of Azure AD SSO that utilizes the SAML protocol for secure authentication. Azure AD SAML SSO is the best option for businesses that use on-premise applications mostly and want to implement a streamlined authentication method to increase productivity among their employees & strengthen overall data security.

**2. Is Azure AD SSO different from Azure AD Seamless SSO?**

Azure AD SSO focuses on providing Single Sign-On capabilities with centralized user management and enhanced security, which is best suited for on-premise environments. Protocols like SAML and OpenID Connect are utilized to establish trust between the identity provider (Azure AD) and the applications. Whereas, Azure AD Seamless SSO takes it a step further by offering a more streamlined and transparent authentication experience, especially for organizations with a hybrid environment. Users are automatically signed in to applications when they are on their corporate network and connected to their domain-joined devices.
