## Introduction

### How to secure your Adobe Connect Login? {#how-to-secure-adobe-connect-login}

Adobe Connect login can be secured with a reverse proxy by configuring HTTP Header Authentication for secure SSO login. With HTTP header-based authentication, users can directly log into Adobe Connect by just clicking on a URL. The Adobe header parameters are set by the reverse proxy for the user at the time of proxied application login, in this case, Adobe Connect login with Adobe Single Sign-On (Adobe Connect SSO).

### What is Adobe Connect Login with HTTP Header-Based Authentication? {#adobe-connect-http-header-authentication}

Adobe Connect SSO with HTTP header-based authentication allows users to be authenticated to access Adobe Connect based on the parameters set in the HTTP headers. Header authentication is used for on-premise backend applications where SSO is not possible and further customizations cannot be done. By enabling Header based authentication with a reverse proxy, users can log in to Adobe Connect on-premise using just the contents of the Adobe header body URL.

Let’s understand the working of HTTP header authentication for Adobe Connect Single Sign-On(SSO) for Adobe guest login.

## Working of HTTP Header-Based Authentication for Adobe Connect Login:

Here’s how a reverse proxy works to protect access to Adobe Connect login.

- The user will try to access Adobe Connect.
- The request will go through the reverse proxy server since Adobe Connect is proxied with it.
- The reverse proxy server will initiate an authorization request to the IDP.
- The user will enter the credentials in the IDP and if authenticated, it will send an authorization response to the reverse proxy server else, the access will be denied.
- Then the reverse proxy server will set the header parameters based on this authentication token and then Adobe Connect can be accessed.
- If the user is not authenticated, an error message will be shown by Adobe Connect.
