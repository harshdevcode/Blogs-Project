[Two-factor authentication](https://plugins.miniorange.com/2-factor-authentication-for-wordpress-wp-2fa) aka 2FA  is a security measure used by WordPress membership sites to add an extra layer of protection to user accounts. It requires users to provide two different forms of verification during the login process, ensuring enhanced security beyond just a username and password.
