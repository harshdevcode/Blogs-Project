## SSO into Jenkins while managing users in Atlassian Crowd

From cell phones to tablets to watches, clients are depending more on the comfort of the versatile innovation of mobile phones because of its easy portability. 

Lately we have seen a huge expansion in the universality of cell phones among people across the globe. These gadgets empower people to introduce a huge collection of tools, known as “applications,” These applications are the quintessence of cell phones, improving their usefulness and upgrading their regular day to day usage. **The application markets permit clients to play out a fast pursuit with establishment of new applications, and yet, they are also a wellspring of various types of malware.** These days, cell phones are dependent upon a wide scope of safety challenges and malevolent dangers.

While adapting to the issue, the objective of this collaboration is to bring you a tad bit nearer to safety and security on mobile phones.

**INFOSYSTA**, the developers of [Mobile for Jira](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1214475/mobile-for-jira?tab=overview&hosting=cloud) and [JSmobile](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1219125/jsmobile-service-management-portal?hosting=cloud&tab=overview) are now integrating with **miniOrange’s [Two factor Authentication (2FA)](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1221260/mo-two-factor-authentication-2fa-for-jira?hosting=datacenter&tab=overview) for JIRA** in their solutions for smartphones.

### Why is Mobile Security a Necessity? {#why-is-mobile-security-a-necessity}

Below are the points why you actually need Mobile Security:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Your private data is always protected: It safeguards your data whether it relates to personal, private or public life and ensures that it is under your control everytime. No one can access it without your authorization.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Your device is protected against malwares: It reduces the chances of viruses and malwares.

### What is 2FA? And How does it work? {#what-is-2fa-and-how-does-it-work}

As found in a lot of news stories about hacks and information leaks, an unprotected password can help cybercriminals access your ledger, charge cards, or gain information on individual sites. 

In any case, the fight isn’t lost. One approach to rapidly support the security of your online records is two-factor authentication — called 2FA — which adds an additional layer of safety to your information.

2FA is a subset of multi-factor authentication. The concept of 2FA is that you need more than just a username and password set to login into an application and if you don’t provide the key to both the factors, authentication fails.

This second factor could emerge out of one of the classifications:

- **Something you know:** This could be a personal identification number (PIN), a password, answers to “secret questions.”
- **Something you have:** Typically, a user would have something in their possession, like a credit card, a smartphone, or a small hardware token.
- **Something you are:** This category is a little more advanced, and might include a biometric pattern of a fingerprint, an iris scan, or a voice print.

It guarantees that regardless of whether your password is exposed to anybody, or on the other hand if it’s stolen through phishing, they will not have the option to get to your information without going through the subsequent factor.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Let’s have a look at the benefits of 2FA:**

- Further developed security: By requiring a second layer of verification, 2FA reduces the chances of getting the data or access under attacks. Regardless of whether a fraudster has access to a password he will not have the subsequent component needed to validate.

- Increase of usefulness and adaptability: Enterprises are accepting 2FA as it adds to a higher level of security. With versatile 2FA methods(SMS/OTP/QR codes), workers can safely get to corporate applications, information, records, and administrative center frameworks from any device or area without putting the corporate organization and data in danger.

### Our Integration {#miniorange-integration}

Realising the threats of cyberattacks, miniOrange developed **Two factor Authentication** to give applications one additional layer of security over just a password. A security which can only be verified by the person who’s information like mobile number or security questions has been set up. In our add-on, there are multiple ways in which you can set up 2FA on mobile phones.

The methods are as follows:
- Mobile Authenticator
- Yubikey Hardware Token
- OTP over Email
- Security Question
- Backup Codes: As the name suggests this authentication method acts as a backup when the passcode/OTP of the primary method is lost.

And to add to that, **Infosysta** is all set with their mobile applications; **Mobile for Jira and JSmobile** to help users for efficient work portability. 

**Infosysta** has now integrated **miniOrange’s Two Factor Authentication** with their Mobile for Jira and JSmobile applications, which are easy to install, configure and use.

With ease of moving from PCs to your mobile phone plus advanced security with 2FA comes together to give you a supportive system.
