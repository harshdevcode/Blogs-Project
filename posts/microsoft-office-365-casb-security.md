- **DLP Integration:** Data Loss Prevention (DLP), is a versatile and custom solution to prevent data breaches, even against the most advanced methods for website security, next-gen firewalls, spam, and phishing attack filters, and many more that work with cloud applications and can even extend to in house on-premise applications.
- **Analytics and Reports:** Monitoring O365 app usage activity and generating threat reports help your teams to find fresh observations. This way you can visualize data to see increased unusual activity with an app and peak downtimes with the Microsoft 365 CASB. This benefits the architecture teams by boosting their infrastructure for improved productivity with strong analytics.
- **User Risk Score Assessment:** Depending on the user activity, a risk score is assigned to each user to flag them based on their activity with Microsoft 365 apps.

### Working of Microsoft 365 CASB for Enterprise security {#working-of-casb-sol}

Let’s see with an example, how the Microsoft [O365 CASB solution](https://www.miniorange.com/blog/ms-365-casb-for-microsoft-teams-security/) works for enterprise security:

Let’s say a company is using Microsoft 365 apps for daily information workflow. The company has enabled IP restriction with a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) and has whitelisted all the IP address ranges for the company network. Suppose there are 2 users: Tony and Joe in the organization. Tony is on the company network and Joe is not on the company network.

A CASB solution can be configured to allow or block users with Microsoft 365 restrictions.

- Since Tony is on the company network, the CASB solution will whitelist his IP address. Hence, he will be authorized to use the Microsoft 365 apps.

- Since Joe is not on the company network, the CASB solution will not whitelist his IP address. Hence, he will not be authorized to access any of the Microsoft 365 apps.
