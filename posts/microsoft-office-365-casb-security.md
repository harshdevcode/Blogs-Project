### Microsoft 365 CASB for Enterprise security {#casb-for-microsoft}

Microsoft 365 CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker) works with your SOC team in monitoring any kind of **“risky business activities”** over the Office 365 apps. This helps them get a wider approach to monitoring user activities and transactions, mitigate threats, have deeper visibility over cloud threats, and perform detailed audits to get deeper insights into potential threats for O365 enterprise security.


For each individual app, you can configure compliance checks to prevent data violations and unauthorized access across teams outside their access scopes. Let’s take a look at some important features provided under miniOrange CASB security (Cloud Access Security Broker). We developed our solution to secure data, data accessibility, and even team exchange of this data.


### Microsoft 365 Enterprise security features {#casb-solution}

Here are the top 6 features of using Microsoft 365 CASB for enterprise security and O365 apps,

- **Granular visibility and control:** You can now obtain insights to the smallest level of detail for each each app under Microsoft 365 suite, and set custom uaser and app access restriction rules to safeguard business data from reaching users out of the defined access scope.
- **Compliance Inclusion:** Microsoft 365 CASB enterprise security ensures that all regulatory industry compliance requirements for businesses are met by configuring data protection rules and detailed insight gathering, prevent users from going against the business security policies, and comply with the industry requirements with the Microsoft 365 CASB solution.
- **DLP Integration:** Data Loss Prevention (DLP), is a versatile and custom solution to prevent data breaches, even against the most advanced methods for website security, next-gen firewalls, spam, and phishing attack filters, and many more that work with cloud applications and can even extend to in house on-premise applications.
- **Analytics and Reports:** Monitoring O365 app usage activity and generating threat reports help your teams to find fresh observations. This way you can visualize data to see increased unusual activity with an app and peak downtimes with the Microsoft 365 CASB. This benefits the architecture teams by boosting their infrastructure for improved productivity with strong analytics.
- **User Risk Score Assessment:** Depending on the user activity, a risk score is assigned to each user to flag them based on their activity with Microsoft 365 apps. Once the score exceeds the threshold value, necessary security restrictions configured will revoke all access and isolate the user from further interacting with the O365 apps with our Microsoft 365 CASB solution for enterprise security.
- **Additional Solutions Incorporation:** Alongside miniOrange CASB security, you can also check out our other Microsoft Office 365 enterprise security products as well. All our solutions can be integrated individually or alongside the miniOrange CASB.


### Working of Microsoft 365 CASB for Enterprise security {#working-of-casb-sol}

Let’s see with an example, how the Microsoft 365 CASB solution works for enterprise security:

Let’s say a company is using Microsoft 365 apps for daily information workflow. The company has enabled IP restriction with a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) and has whitelisted all the IP address ranges for the company network. Suppose there are 2 users: Tony and Joe in the organization. Tony is on the company network and Joe is not on the company network.

A CASB solution can be configured to allow or block users with Microsoft 365 restrictions.

- Since Tony is on the company network, the CASB solution will whitelist his IP address. Hence, he will be authorized to use the Microsoft 365 apps.

- Since Joe is not on the company network, the CASB solution will not whitelist his IP address. Hence, he will not be authorized to access any of the Microsoft 365 apps.
