### Working of miniOrange CASB for Microsoft Office 365 {#working-of-casb-sol}

Let’s see how Microsoft Office 365 CASB solution security works with an example:

Let’s say a company is using Microsoft 365 apps for daily information workflow. The company has enabled IP restriction with a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) and has whitelisted all the IP address ranges for the company network. Suppose there are 2 users: Tony and Joe in the organization. Tony is on the company network and Joe is not on the company network.

A CASB solution can be configured to allow or block users with Microsoft 365 restrictions.

- Since Tony is on the company network, the CASB solution will whitelist his IP address. Hence, he will be authorized to use the Microsoft 365 apps.
- Since Joe is not on the company network, the CASB solution will not whitelist his IP address. Hence, he will not be authorized to access any of the Microsoft 365 apps.
