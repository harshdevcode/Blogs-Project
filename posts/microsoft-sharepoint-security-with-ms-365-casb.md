All these amazing features of Sharepoint comes the looming threat of business data security and the potential threat of leaking business sensitive data from within the enterprise. To mitigate such a disaster, your business needs the Microsoft 365 CASB security solution for data security while keeping your business compliant. In this blog, we will see how the Microsoft 365 CASB works to provide data security and compliance for Microsoft Sharepoint security. So let’s get started!

### **What is Microsoft SharePoint?** {#what-is-sharepoint}

Microsoft SharePoint is a web-based platform that allows organizations to create, manage, and share documents, content, and collaborative tools. It offers a seamless collaboration, version control system, and information sharing offering between teams and office departments, to improve productivity and communication within an organization.

&nbsp;

Microsoft Sharepoint simplifies the project and streamlines the process of data sharing and brings transparency into the organization.

### **Why do you need Microsoft SharePoint security?** {#why-sharepoint-security}

With all these features and ease of access for employees, there is a very likely possibility of data leaks within the organization and disgruntled employees may purposefully leak company sensitive data. Due to a lack of security protocols and in-app security restrictions, these user can download all the sensitive files onto their personal devices and share them to an untrusted third-party resource.

&nbsp;

This is why you need Microsoft Sharepoint security and set up a CASB solution for MS 365 to help your SOC team detect in mitigate these threat vectors before they cause an irreversible amount of damage to the company’s reputation.

&nbsp;

Now let’s understand how the [MS 365 CASB](https://www.miniorange.com/blog/ms-365-casb-for-microsoft-teams-security/) ensures Microsoft Sharepoint security in detail.

### **How can you provide Microsoft Sharepoint security with MS 365 CASB?** {#sharepoint-ms365-casb}

The Microsoft 365 CASB security solution is designed to mitigate any form of corporate espionage, detect **“risky business practices”**, and set security restrictions over your entire Microsoft 365 app suite, including [Microsoft Sharepoint](https://www.miniorange.com/blog/microsoft-sharepoint-security-with-ms-365-casb/), to provide transparency to your SOC team and alert them a malicious activity is detected.

&nbsp;

With the MS 365 CASB, you can configure individual app security policies and compliance rules, including Microsoft Sharepoint security, to prevent data violations and prevent users from accessing the data from outside the scope of access. The CASB is designed to provide Compliance, Data Security, Threat Detection, and grants Deep visibility into user actions.

### Working example of MS 365 CASB for enabling Microsoft SharePoint Security {#working-of-ms365-casb}

Suppose we have a user, Brian, who is collaborating with his team in completing a project that needs to be delivered on time to a client. Due to the sensitive nature of the client, the team members have been advised to work on anything related to the project using their office-authorized laptops only. But Brian decides to work again once he reaches home, and logs in to the company account using his personal laptop.

&nbsp;

As soon as he opens the Microsoft Sharepoint, miniOrange MS 365 CASB security protocols kick in and detect that an unauthorized device has tried to access Microsoft Sharepoint. It immediately blocks access to Sharepoint, and further revokes all access to Brian’s account from accessing any other application data so as to isolate the threat.

The Microsoft 365 CASB then alerts the SOC team members of malicious activity threatening the Sharepoint data. Once the SOC team has checked and verified that Brian’s activity was not a threat to the Sharepoint data, his access permissions are reinstated and he can now resume using Microsoft Sharepoint but only through his work laptop.
