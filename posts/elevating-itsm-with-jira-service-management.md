## Elevating ITSM with Jira Service Management {#fortify-your-defenses}

IT service management platforms (ITSM) facilitate workflow management and data collection so businesses can plan, automate, control, and deliver seamless digital experiences. [According to the Gartner report Magic Quadrant for IT Service Management Platforms](https://www.atlassian.com/gartner/magic-quadrant-it-service-management-tools#:~:text=31%20October%202022.-,Atlassian%20is%20a%20Leader%20in%20the%202022%20Gartner%C2%AE%20Magic,service%20marks%20of%20Gartner%2C%20Inc.), Atlassian, with its Jira Service Management, is a leader in this area. In the ever-evolving landscape of IT service management (ITSM), seamless service delivery isn't just a goal; it's a necessity. 

&nbsp;

However, with the exchange of sensitive data being the norm, security isn’t just an option, it’s become the cornerstone of trust in such applications. Ensuring robust security for external customer portals has become paramount. Many organizations grapple with the challenges of Single Sign-On (SSO) integration and the complexities of managing a multitude of customer accounts. These hurdles can impede the seamless operation of Jira Service Management (JSM) Cloud, creating roadblocks for both businesses and their valued customers.
What was once a challenging endeavor has now been simplified with a groundbreaking solution: [SAML/OAuth SSO for JSM Customers](https://www.miniorange.com/atlassian/sso-for-jsm-customers) brought to you by [miniOrange](https://www.miniorange.com/).

&nbsp;

In this article, we delve deep into the realm of security enhancements, shedding light on the transformative capabilities of SSO for portal-only customers within the JSM Cloud environment and a couple of other extensions that would add value to your ITSM.


### Enhancing Security for Portal-Only Customers in JSM {#enhancing-security-for-portal-only-customers}

Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities have been a significant challenge for Jira Service Management (JSM) Cloud users, particularly those with portal-only customers. Managing thousands of customer accounts can become cumbersome. However, imagine the convenience of allowing external customers to log in via SSO to your JSM portals. **miniOrange presents an exclusive solution** – [SAML/OAuth SSO for JSM Customers](https://www.miniorange.com/atlassian/sso-for-jsm-customers).
Our app extends SAML SSO capabilities to portal-only customers effortlessly. You only need to connect to your identity provider (e.g.miniOrange,Okta, AzureAD) through the app, enabling a secure and streamlined authentication process for external customers. 

&nbsp;

![Configuring SSO With Multiple Identity Provider](/blog/assets/2023/jsm-configure-idps.webp)

&nbsp;

Once authenticated through their identity provider, users establish a session on the JSM portal. With this session, they can access and monitor the progress of their tickets and perform relevant actions. This solution grants users access to the portal using their existing authentication credentials from a trusted identity provider.

&nbsp;

Let's explore how these improvements can empower your IT service management.

### Unlocking the Benefits {#unlocking-the-benefits-empowring-itsm-enhanced-security}

Enhanced security measures for portal-only customers within Jira Service Management Cloud offer not just protection, but a gateway to a world of advantages that elevates your IT Service Management (ITSM) strategy.

**Enhanced Security:**

By adding an additional layer of authentication, it ensures that your external customers must prove their identity before accessing the portal. This helps verify the legitimacy of users and prevents automated bots from creating accounts and submitting spam tickets easily.

&nbsp;


**Centralized User Management**

Leveraging an identity provider allows you to maintain a single source of truth for user identities and access controls of your external customers.
In addition to these benefits, our integration offers some notable features:

- Support for both SAML + OAuth/OIDC Protocols: This support allows you to seamlessly connect Atlassian Cloud to your OAuth/OIDC provider, ensuring a smooth authentication experience.

- Organization Mapping Based on Customer Domains and IDP Groups: Automatically assigns customers to specific organizations based on email domains and IDP groups, streamlining support workflows.

&nbsp;

- Multiple Identity Provider (IDP) Support: Users can choose from different trusted authentication sources when logging into the system.
- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on top of SSO: Adds an extra layer of security by requiring two forms of verification before granting access, enhancing portal security.
-  Easy User Management and Custom Domain Support: Simplifies user management, audit logs, and troubleshooting with quick access to help center links and configurable ticket fields.

&nbsp;

While [SAML/OAuth SSO for JSM Customers](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1229212/saml-oauth-sso-for-jsm-customers?hosting=cloud&tab=overview) addresses the pressing issue of security and user management in ITSM, a well-rounded ITSM solution demands more. As organizations of all sizes embrace Jira Service Management, we delve deeper into its core functionalities and explore how it fosters collaboration among development, infrastructure, and business teams.


### How to boost Jira Service Management {#how-to-boost-jira-service-management}

To truly enhance the customer-agent relationship and improve workflow efficiency, additional functionalities are often necessary in Jira Service management. Agents frequently encounter challenges such as insufficient information or delays in ticket resolution due to waiting for customer responses. This is where solutions like **'Customer and Organization Management' or ‘Feature Bundle for Jira Service Management' by Appsvio come into play**. Let’s check these extensions out…


&nbsp;

![Jira Customer Fields](/blog/assets/2023/jira-customer-fields.webp)

&nbsp;


**Customer and Organization Management**

This app addresses the information gap by facilitating fast and easy data gathering. It allows agents to collect additional customer context directly from the issue view. Customizing forms is straightforward; users can select field types and drag and drop them into the customer view. The collected data can be used to define JQL and SLA criteria, expediting request creation by copying values from the customer's profile to the issue.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Customer and Organization Management also supports bulk actions, making it possible to assign customers to projects and organizations efficiently. This not only saves time for agents but also enhances communication by providing easy access to customer and organization information.


## Feature Bundle for Jira Service Management {#feature-bundle-of-jira-service-management}

Effective communication with customers is another key aspect of the Jira Service Management Portal. The 'Feature Bundle for Jira Service Management' offers banner functionality, enabling businesses to keep customers well-informed without inundating them with emails and announcements.
It's time to put more into customers' hands! With this feature, you can allow customers to edit their requests. Changing minds is natural. Why engage agents every single time to apply changes? Imagine that you have to modify dozens of requests one day – a waste of time. In our scenario, customers can decide on their own and make changes with ease.

&nbsp;

As an admin, you can define who is able to edit the request: Reporter/Participants/ Organizations. Appsvio once again uses drag-and-drop functionality to make it possible to create a form. Decide which fields can be edited. What’s interesting, it also supports Assets formerly known as Insight, so you can customize it as you need. 

&nbsp;


Another feature that empowers customers’ is the ability to display a customer's workflow can greatly improve the customer experience. Similar to tracking a package delivery, customers can now see where their requests stand in the process. With Feature Bundle, you can add workflow information to the request view and define conditions for when steps change, providing customers with real-time updates.

## Final Word {#final-word}

Jira Service Management and SSO Integration are powerful tools in the realm of ITSM. While SSO Integration enhances security and user convenience, Jira Service Management thrives when complemented by extensions like 'Customer and Organization Management.'
