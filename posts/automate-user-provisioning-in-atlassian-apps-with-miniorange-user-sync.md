## Automate User Provisioning in Atlassian apps with miniOrange User Sync ‚öôÔ∏è üë§ {#Automate User Provisioning in Atlassian apps }

Licensing has become a dicey subject and the budget pressure on companies is on an entirely different level. As your company grows, manually managing the entire Access Management is a hassle. For every user or employee of the company that uses Jira, Confluence or Service Management, they must have the necessary access rights in order for them to work efficiently. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;

Your Organization can suffer from a series of difficulties with manual process:

1. **Poor Onboarding Experience:** as new employees join, they wait for their Jira, Confluence account while the IT team take time off their schedule

&nbsp;&nbsp;

2. **Time Constraints:** With constant changes in organizations like promotions, revamped job descriptions, gaining the right access for employees is a time taking process. Without automated processes to align permissions and application access, the time taken to bring in these changes can sink your productivity.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

3. **Higher licensing Costs and Security Risks:** According to estimates, **30% of all Atlassian user licenses are unused**. This happens because users that leave the organization or change roles don‚Äôt have their accounts deactivated in a timely manner. This can have negative consequences, like exceeding license limits leading to an **increase in licensing costs**. Retaining access from former employees ‚Äì poses a major security concerns. This is a major concern for confidential information of your company.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

You need to constantly make sure that the product access is limited to those who still have a valid business purpose and they have access to only what they have to need. **Manually provisioning users/groups makes it absolutely intolerable and inefficient. This not only increases the workload but also means duplicate work for the administrator.**

With the help of user provisioning the user accounts are automatically created, given proper permissions, and maintained across all Atlassian applications. 

1. Keep your Atlassian instances 100% accurate with user provisioning so that all your Atlassian users are up to date and have access to what they need. [User provisioning].

2. Disable, deactivate or delete inactive users (user deprovisioning) automatically after x days. 

3. Manage group membership on the Central Identity Provider to make sure every user has the right permissions and see the right projects. 

At this point you must be wondering how I can automate User provisioning in Atlassian applications.
