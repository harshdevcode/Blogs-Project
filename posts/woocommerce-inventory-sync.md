Poor inventory management is often a result of inefficient inventory tracking, not reordering products on time, or having an improper ordering system. **A recent study shows that businesses that forget to reorder on time face a whopping 70-75% of stockouts**.
 
The good news is that there's a way to automate this: [WooCommerce Inventory Sync](https://plugins.miniorange.com/woocommerce-api-product-sync-with-woocommerce-rest-apis)! A powerful tool that can automatically import and keep track of all product stocks in your WooCommerce store's inventory so you'll never miss a sale! 

&nbsp;

Let’s explore what Inventory Sync is, why it's essential for modern businesses on WooCommerce, and how it can upgrade your WooCommerce inventory management practices.


## What is Inventory Syncing? {#what-is-inventory-sync}

Inventory syncing is the process of automatically importing products from supplier inventory to your WooCommerce or Shopify store.

&nbsp;

**Let’s explain this with an example:** 

&nbsp;

**Consider this scenario:** Imagine you run a business that sells electronic gadgets, both online and in-store. Inventory syncing **automatically updates stock levels** and **imports new product details from supplier inventory** across all your online stores as required. 

&nbsp;

Whenever a customer buys something, no matter which store, the remaining stock levels get instantly adjusted across your other stores. This **prevents you from accidentally selling products** you no longer have in stock and keeps your inventory updated whenever new stocks arrive. 

&nbsp;

In simpler terms, inventory syncing makes sure that your online and offline stock are always in sync, avoiding confusion and saving you tons of time managing everything. 


## Reasons Why You Need WooCommerce Inventory Sync {#why-you-need-woocommerce-sync}

Inventory synchronization is crucial for managing modern WooCommerce stores as it ensures your products are available for purchase, which directly impacts sales and customer satisfaction. Synchronizing your inventory offers several benefits that can positively impact your business. 

&nbsp;

Here are some of the top reasons why your WooCommerce stores should use inventory sync solution:

&nbsp;

**1) Saves Time:** 

 **Did you know that the issue of out-of-stock inventory has caused 34% of businesses to ship their orders late?**

 One of the reasons why you must try WooCommerce inventory sync solution is that it **saves you a ton of time**. Instead of updating your inventory manually, this solution **automatically keeps your stock levels accurate and imports product details from the supplier’s store**.

 Automatically updating your inventory means your customers will only see what's actually in stock in your retail and WooCommerce stores. This prevents them from trying to buy items that are unavailable, making **shopping easier** and **building trust** with your customers.

&nbsp;

 Stockouts happen when products are unavailable for sale due to depleted inventory. On the other hand, overstock occurs when too much inventory is ordered, leading to excess stock in your storage space.
