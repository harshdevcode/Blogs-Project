## How does NFT token gated discord work?

A discord server owner locks/restricts his channel behind a token-gated portal. Users log in to the Discord web client, where Web3 verifies if they hold the required NFT collection or token in their crypto wallet. Depending on the collection or token owned, roles are assigned, granting access to specific Discord channels. If a user lacks the necessary token, they are redirected to popular NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, Rarible, or Mintable to acquire them.
