However, this shift to remote and hybrid work can compromise an organization's cybersecurity if security measures are not taken. According to a recent study by Alliance Virtual Offices, the number of cyberattacks has increased by 238% since the start of the pandemic, with remote workers serving as the main target of crimes.
 
To prevent such security concerns, companies should implement advanced remote work security measures like mobile device management (MDM) solutions to harness the benefits of remote or hybrid working. In this blog, we'll explore what MDM is and why mobile device management is important for your business. 

We’ll also look at the benefits of MDM and provide you with the best [mobile device management solutions](https://www.miniorange.com/mobile-device-management/) that’ll work perfectly for securing your business.

So Let’s Dive In!

## What is Mobile Device Management (MDM)?

Mobile Device Management (MDM) is a security solution that allows for remote monitoring and management of employee devices. It basically allows you to identify, control, and secure your employees' remote devices in order to prevent potential cyberattacks.

### Dangers of Not Using MDM {#not-using-mdm}

Imagine that you have fired a remote employee or that your current employee's device has been lost or stolen. How would you protect your business data stored on these devices in such a situation? 
It is certain that without mobile device management (MDM), your remote devices are no longer secure. This makes your sensitive business data vulnerable, and the risk of contracting malware and other viruses is significantly high. 

### Why use MDM? {#why-mdm}

Mobile Device Management (MDM) lets you make the most of a remote or hybrid working model while keeping things in check and secure. It's all about enhancing remote work security and protecting your data. MDM helps you fix problems from afar, enhances security by enforcing robust policies, and enables device tracking and management in case of loss or theft.

Plus, it acts as a productivity booster as it helps you handle apps remotely and keep everything up to date. All this means less downtime and happier, more productive employees.

### Top Benefits of Mobile Device Management (MDM) {#benefits}

**1. Limited File Transfer**

IT administrators can control and limit file transfers using robust MDM policies and configurations, lowering the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access. MDM solutions typically allow administrators to specify which apps and services can be used for file transfers, the types of files that can be shared, and even the location of these files. These limitations ensure that private company information stays within the bounds of approved channels, preventing the accidental or intentional leakage of sensitive data.

**2. Easy Remote Device Monitoring** 

The primary benefit of mobile device management (MDM) is that it enables businesses to monitor and manage devices remotely. The ability to disable specific users, even if they are not on-premises, through remote management further improves network security. To ensure seamless protection and support, it applies updated regulations across all networked devices.

**3. Prevent Screen Recording** 

MDM can help prevent screen recording by enforcing security policies on devices. It can assist businesses in configuring devices to restrict the use of specific apps or features for screen recording. This prevents sensitive business information from leaking outside the organization. 

**4. Improved Cyber Security** 

Get deep insights into user actions and gain visibility into what they are accessing and the cloud resources they are using.For businesses, a lost device may not be as important as lost data. The costs associated with data loss are much higher for any organization. A similar threat to organizations is data theft caused by malware and phishing attacks. With an MDM solution, companies can easily update remote devices, encrypt sensitive corporate data, and create a barrier between employee and company data. 

**5. Supports Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)** 

Nowadays, a lot of businesses choose to allow employees to bring their own devices to work. This boosts productivity for the company but increases the risk to data security. By using MDM, organizations can safeguard their data without hampering the device’s personal usability for employees.

**6. Erase Data on Remote Devices** 

Mobile device management solutions can remotely locate, lock, and erase data from an employee's device to protect sensitive information. This particularly comes in handy in the event that an employee's remote device gets lost or stolen.

**7. Restricted Personal Email** 

MDM can restrict staff members from accessing their work profiles when they use their personal email addresses. This prevents the possibility of sharing sensitive business information through personal email IDs.

**8. Up-to-Date Device Security & Support** 

It is vital to keep remote devices up-to-date and compliant with your company's latest security policies. When employees fail to update their devices, it opens the door for hackers to use any gaps to get their hands on sensitive business information. Using mobile device management (MDM), businesses can centrally control updates and apply system changes to devices across the network with just a few clicks saving employee time and reducing downtimes during peak work hours.

**9. Enhanced Device Tracking** 

MDM software gives you the power to keep track of all your remote work devices. Organizations can use this to make sure devices are used within a designated location or area. MDM benefits you with advanced features for Wi-Fi and VPNs that make data super secure. It can make a device always use a VPN or make certain apps use one. 

**10. Reduce IT Administration** 

As more companies use remote devices, IT administrators must manually configure each one, which is challenging to scale. MDM software enables IT teams to manage remote devices with ease. A Quick Response (QR) code, a Near Field Communication (NFC) bump, or a Device Policy Controller (DPC) are examples of bulk enrollment tools that make it simple for IT teams to configure at scale with security and consistency.
