## From Authentication to Empowerment: Harnessing OAuth and OpenID Connect for Atlassian App Advancements {#harnessing-oauth-and-openid-connect-for-atlassian-appdvancements}


So, you're in the midst of migrating your company's applications to a Data Center, huh? Well, you're definitely not alone. As the end of Server support looms, many companies are jumping on the migration bandwagon. And one thing they're considering is implementing Single sign-on (SSO) for their applications.

&nbsp;

Why, you ask? Well, SSO offers a slew of benefits like enhanced security, improved usability, and lower IT costs. Sounds pretty appealing, right? But here's the thing: when you're making the move to a data center and have an OAuth/OIDC provider, you'll need to decide if the native OAuth/OpenID Connect (OIDC) SSO option is the way to go.

&nbsp;

Now, let's talk about Atlassian's native OAuth/OIDC SSO. It's a simple implementation, sure, but it requires manual work and falls short of the features needed by major enterprises. And here's another challenge: configuring SSO within a reasonable timeframe is no walk in the park. Plus, debugging authentication issues without the right expertise can be a real headache. How long can you afford to troubleshoot while your users are left unable to access Jira? Definitely not ideal, right?

&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Empowering Your Data Center Setup with miniOrange OAuth/OpenID Connect {#empowering-your-data-center-setup-with-miniOrange-oauth-openid-connect}


This is where miniOrange comes to the rescue! Our [OAuth/OpenID Connect SSO](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?query=OAuth%20miniOrange) solution for Atlassian Data Center is packed with a whole bunch of powerful features. With miniOrange, you can achieve seamless login across Atlassian applications like Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket, and Bamboo with your OAuth or OIDC provider. Say goodbye to repeatedly entering credentials for each app!

&nbsp;

So, if you're looking to supercharge your Atlassian Data Center setup and keep your system secure, adding advanced SSO features on top of Jira and Confluence's native SSO is a must. We've got your back. Ready to explore the world of hassle-free authentication? Let's dive in!

&nbsp;

### Enhanced Security with Single Logout/OIDC Logout {#enhanced-security-with-single-logout-oidc-logout}


Do you know how sometimes we forget to log out of all the applications we use? Well, that can make our Atlassian applications vulnerable to cyberattacks. But don't worry; with the OIDC logout endpoint, once you log out from one of your connected applications, all the other applications connected to the provider log out automatically.

&nbsp;

A best practice supported by the OIDC protocol is to close all your sessions centrally from just one application! and it's a great way to keep your accounts safe and secure. No more worrying about leaving sessions open in multiple places. It's a game-changer for security!

&nbsp;

### Manage User Permissions in Data Center {#manage-user-permissions-in-data-center}


Handling users and their permissions in Atlassian applications can be quite a challenge for administrators. Automated provisioning makes things easier, and with this feature, administrators can manage groups in the OAuth/OpenID Provider and then sync or provision them in SSO-connected Atlassian applications.

&nbsp;

Now, here's where miniOrange's SSO plugin goes a little beyond. It lets you pick whether you want to sync all groups or just specific ones from the OAuth/OpenID Provider, depending on what suits your needs best. You also have the flexibility to include local groups and set up a few important groups as Default groups. What's neat is that after a user logs in through Single sign-on, these assigned groups will automatically be configured for them. 

&nbsp;
### Connect With Multiple Identity Provider Eas {#connect-with-multiple-identity-provider-eas}


When it comes to Enterprise organizations using Data Centers, things can get pretty complex, especially with their identity infrastructure. They have a bunch of Identity providers, some of which even use custom OAuth providers. And guess what? Different branches and divisions might be using them all at the same time.

&nbsp;

But don't worry, we've got you covered with miniOrange OAuth/OIDC SSO, as you can easily add multiple identity providers and enjoy a seamless login experience. No more headaches, just smooth sailing!

&nbsp;


### A Safety Net With Emergency URL and Group Restriction {#a-safety-net-with-emergency-url-and-group-restriction}


A valuable feature that provides a safety net for your users in case of any issues with your identity provider. This feature enables access to Jira/Confluence's default login page, allowing users to bypass Single sign-on and use their local credentials in case of disruptions. Even if SSO is enforced for all users, the emergency URL empowers you to access the default login page effortlessly.

&nbsp;

And to add an extra layer of security, we offer Group Restriction functionality. By enabling Group Restriction, you can specify certain user groups that will have exclusive access to the Emergency URL and, subsequently, the default login page. With these powerful options, you can ensure smooth operations and enhanced security for your Jira/Confluence environment.

&nbsp;

### Reduce Setup Time & Avoid Misconfiguration {#reduce-setup-time-and-avoid-misconfiguration}

When testing your setup in the test environment, you can conveniently export the configuration and apply it to the production environment. By utilizing the exported data, administrators can avoid the need to reconfigure settings from scratch, significantly reducing setup time and minimizing the risk of critical system misconfigurations. This feature is exclusive to administrators.

&nbsp;
