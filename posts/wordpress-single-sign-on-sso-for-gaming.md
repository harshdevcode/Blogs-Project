### Why is it the Best Time to Implement Single Sign-On (SSO) for Your Gaming Community? {#best-time-for-sso}

1.)**Gamers expect SSO:** In the current scenario, gamers are expecting SSO in every game available because it saves their time and they don’t have to remember multiple credentials. If you have a gaming store that requires logging in before accessing anything then Single sign-on (SSO) is a must if you don’t want to annoy your customer.
