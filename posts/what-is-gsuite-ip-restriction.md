Cloud technology is undeniably considered paramount everywhere in the tech market. The rationale behind this is the emerging growth of Cloud technology in multiple businesses and enterprises to manage Data / Services which helps them to streamline their organizational process. G Suite is one of the most favored user-friendly Cloud technology, which is easily accessible from any device or location, irrational to organizational access parameters. G Suite continuously strives to supply additional features uniformly for the convenience of users. But still, there are a few aspects in G Suite that can’t be easily handled around access control and device management, due to the frontline feature that Google always promises of “anytime, anywhere and with any device”.

Easy cloud access to G Suite also brings up a set of challenges associated with security concerns to stop your data from being accessed by unauthorized users protecting it from various sorts of cyber threats. Maintaining the safety of such broad-driven cloud applications (Gmail, Google Drive) is one of the challenges within the modernized world. Here IP restriction for G Suite comes within the frame and is considered one of the proven solutions for handling these sorts of use cases.

To get specific inference regarding what **G suite IP restriction** is and the way it works we’d like to urge clear about a few basic aspects:-

- **What is IP restriction for G Suite?**
- **Why does your organization need IP restriction for G Suite?**
- **Why use miniOrange to protect your G Suite Data?**

### What is IP Restriction for G Suite? {#what-is-ip-restriction-for-gsuite}

IP Restriction termed as Internet Protocol Restriction allows admin or organization owners to restrict access to their business data to respective users and employees only through the specified and registered IP addresses. Allowing or restricting user access is often achieved with a separated IP as well as a variety of IP addresses. The IP restrictions are often set of different levels and combinations like defined IP ranges or individual IP addresses. Enabling IP restriction for G Suite ensures that your important data can’t be accessed at an unsecured public place or through an unregistered IP address.

Considering a real-time example, in a corporation you being an admin have whitelisted your employee’s device’s [Mobiles, PC’s] IP addresses and accordingly permitted access to your organization data. Now suppose if an employee is using the whitelisted device in an organization’s premises i.e he can easily access data and work around it accordingly. For a short time, if he tries to access data from his device being home, he won’t be allowed to access data as his device isn’t whitelisted by admin and secondly, he’s not operating the device from the required location he’s alleged to be.

IP restriction is enabled for various security purposes like reducing redundancy, bandwidth issues, and handling control of websites with efficient recovery. If a user tries to log in outside the required range, it’ll throw an error and a specific employee/ user won’t be unable to login and access the info. This feature is employed in various organizations within the Finance industry, Logistics, E-Commerce industry, Automobile segment, Manufacturing sector, IT industry, Educational sector, and Healthcare sector (KPOs).

### Why does your organization need IP restriction for G Suite? {#why-does-your-organization-need-ip-restriction-for-gsuite?}

Startups, mid-level organizations, and enormous enterprises are shifting over advanced cloud services to streamline their processing. G Suite, one of the foremost used cloud technologies, offers piles of services like Emailing, Google Calendar, Document – Presentation, file sharing, video apps, etc in a single package. As Google suite provides multiple offerings to numerous people directly, G Suite must cope up with multidimensional cloud computing security challenges. Although Google as a brand keeps no stone unturned to keep their users’ data safe with robust security protection, it still becomes difficult to cope up with distinct cyber threats within the cyber world.

Therefore, multiple cloud security companies came with the feature of IP restriction for G Suite. It enables the admin to shortlist IP addresses or a specific range of addresses, which then lets users transfer data or do further services from those registered IPs only. This IP restriction method indirectly prevents spoofing through manual defining of  IP ranges. Overall, there exist two ways of enabling IP restriction for Google Suite, One through a manual process or third-party cloud Security vendor.
