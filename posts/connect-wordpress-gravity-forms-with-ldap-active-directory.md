Gravity Forms is a popular WordPress plugin that allows you to easily create and manage various types of forms. From simple contact forms to complex surveys, gravity forms provide a flexible interface for collecting data. In this blog post, we will explore the benefits of integrating Gravity Forms with LDAP or Active Directory to enable seamless authentication and data synchronization with your organization’s user directory.

### **What is Gravity Forms Integration?** {#what-is-gravity-forms-integration}

Gravity forms integration refers to the process of connecting gravity forms with WordPress plugins. Integration with other systems expands the capabilities of Gravity Forms and enables data synchronization, automation, and enhanced functionality.

## **Why Integrate Gravity Forms with LDAP/Active Directory?**

Are you bored of entering your data every time you need to fill out the form, filling out the same information for multiple forms? Don’t worry we have gravity forms plugin integration that will [integrate Gravity Forms with LDAP/Active Directory](https://plugins.miniorange.com/wordpress-ldap-login-intranet-sites). With the help of this plugin integration, you can log in using your LDAP/Active Directory login credentials. No need to fill the form input fields manually, the fields will automatically get filled using LDAP/Active directory attributes. And for extra security, you can even enforce LDAP login to submit the form.

### **Benefits of WordPress Gravity Forms and LDAP / Active Directory Integration:** {#benefits-of-ldap-active-directory-integration-with-gravity-forms}

- **User Data Pre-Filling:**  
    No need to fill the form fields manually, the gravity forms integration will automatically fill the form fields using the information stored on the LDAP/Active directory. When users log in using their LDAP credentials, gravity forms can retrieve their details such as name, email, department, job title, phone number, etc, from the LDAP server and prefill the respective fields in the form. This feature saves time and reduces the chances of errors during data entry.

- **User Group Management:**  
    LDAP/Active Directory integration allows you to map user groups to specific form permissions. This gives you fine-grained access control and enhances security. You can control which users or groups of users have access to a particular form based on their LDAP/Active Directory group membership. This will ensure that only authorized users have access to submit the form.

- **Real-time user sync:**  
    Gravity Forms integration with LDAP/Active Directory facilitates real-time synchronization of user data. Any change made in the LDAP / Active Directory, such as user updates is automatically reflected in the gravity forms data fields. This ensures that the form submission and user information remain up to date in the Gravity Forms.

- **Workflow Automation:**  
    By integrating Gravity Forms with LDAP / Active Directory, you can automate various workflows within your organization. For example, you can configure the form to trigger actions like onboarding / offboarding users, sending email notifications, or initiating approval processes.


Whether you need to collect user feedback, manage event registrations, or conduct surveys, Gravity Forms Integration with LDAP/Active Directory provides a powerful solution that aligns seamlessly with your organization. With the help of this integration create a more efficient and secure data collection system for your WordPress site.
